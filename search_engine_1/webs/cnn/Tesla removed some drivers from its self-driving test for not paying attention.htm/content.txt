New York (CNN Business) Tesla has expanded its "full self-driving" software to roughly 2,000 Tesla owners, but some drivers were revoked access for not paying close enough attention to the road, according to Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.

"FSD Beta has now been expanded ... we've also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road, Musk said in a tweet on Friday. "No accidents to date."

FSD Beta has now been expanded to ~2000 owners & we've also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road. No accidents to date.



Next significant release will be in April. Going with pure vision — not even using radar. This is the way to real-world AI. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 12, 2021

It's unclear how many drivers were revoked access from the beta software. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of drivers who lost access to the program.

The beta version of "full self-driving" was released in October of last year. Tesla's use of the term "full self-driving" has long been controversial, and criticized by autonomous vehicle experts. To most experts, full self-driving means a car in which a person could safely fall asleep behind the wheel. An attentive human driver isn't needed.

The news comes after reports that a letter was sent in February from the National Transportation Safety Board to the National Highway Traffic Safety calling for stricter requirements on autonomous driving testing on public roads.
