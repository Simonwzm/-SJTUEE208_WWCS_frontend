New York (CNN Business) Apple may be doing away with one of its most divisive pieces of technology this year, and some fans aren't sorry to see it go.

While the MacBook Pro design hasn't changed significantly in five years, Apple will eliminate its digital Touch Bar, according to a January memo from Ming-Chi Kuo, a top Apple analyst with TF International Securities. CNN Business translated the memo from Chinese.

Apple first unveiled the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro in 2016. It's a small rectangular OLED touchscreen that replaced the row of function keys at the top of the keyboard. Its digital interface includes other features like text prediction and shortcuts. Apple app developers are able to make software to take advantage of the touchscreen's capabilities.

Apple fans are divided on how they feel about the Touch Bar. Some love it for the ease of use, but others miss the physical buttons it replaced.

Kuo's memo predicts that the Touch Bar is going away in two 2021 MacBook Pro models, a 14-inch laptop and a 16-inch laptop, and that the old physical buttons will return. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.
