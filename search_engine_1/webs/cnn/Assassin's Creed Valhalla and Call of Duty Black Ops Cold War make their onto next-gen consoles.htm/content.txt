New York (CNN Business) It's been a busy week in video games, as the long-awaited next-gen consoles from Xbox and PlayStation made their way to people's homes. While many gamers reported problems getting consoles before websites sold out of them, the lucky few who managed buy a console may be looking for new games to try.

So it's hardly a surprise that the "Call of Duty" and "Assassin's Creed" franchises put out new releases this week. "Assassin's Creed Valhalla," about Vikings and Norse mythology, debuted on November 10, the same day as the Xbox Series X. Three days later, "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War," set in the 1980s, was released.

"Valhalla" had twice as many active players on launch day as did Ubisoft's 2018 "Assassin's Creed" game, "Odyssey," the company said in a press release, without providing specifics. The game features a new setting in England's Dark Ages, which Ubisoft said revives "the age-old battle between Assassins and Templars the fans are familiar with." It is the 13th main game in the franchise.

Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, said that relatively low competition around the holiday season will help "Assassin's Creed Valhalla" as will the game's mystical setting, which could appeal to fans of the franchise. He predicts that like previously successful "Assassin's Creed" titles, the game could sell 10 to 12 million copies, marking a solid hit for Ubisoft.

"[It would be] as good as the best in their lineup," said Pachter, estimating that even the least successful titles tend to sell 7 million copies.
