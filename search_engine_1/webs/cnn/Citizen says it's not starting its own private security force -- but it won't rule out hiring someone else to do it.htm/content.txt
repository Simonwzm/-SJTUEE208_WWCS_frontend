(CNN Business) Citizen, an app that started as a service for real-time crime alerts made waves late last week with news that it was testing a private, on-demand security force, after a company-branded patrol car was spotted in Los Angeles. Now the company has said that test is over, and that it will not launch its own private security force in the future -- but would not rule out partnerships with other companies that would accomplish the same thing.

Citizen said Wednesday that the program it had been testing with some of its employees in Los Angeles, which provided those who were part of the test with an on-demand "personal rapid response service" with a third-party provider, has concluded.

The company, a four-year-old startup, is best known for sending local safety notifications to its 7 million users to alert them to nearby incidents such as robberies and fires.

The "personal rapid response service" test, first reported by Vice last Friday, sparked questions and concerns about the potential use cases and pitfalls of on-demand privatized security. A Citizen spokesperson said in a statement Monday to CNN Business that an example of its potential intended use would be "if someone would like an escort to walk them home late at night, they can request this service."

On Wednesday, as first reported by CBS , a Citizen spokesperson said the company's 30-day contract with the third party provider, Los Angeles Professional Security, for the trial program is now over.
