San Francisco (CNN Business) YouTube is banning several types of advertisers from one of the most prominent spots on its homepage.

The video streaming platform said Monday that it will ban ads related to gambling, alcohol and prescription drugs, as well as political and election ads, from its masthead â€” the banner displayed at the top of its website and apps.

"We believe this update will build on changes we made last year to the masthead reservation process and will lead to a better experience for users," a spokesperson for Google, which owns YouTube, said in a statement to CNN Business.
