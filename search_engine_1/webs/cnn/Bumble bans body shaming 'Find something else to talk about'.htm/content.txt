(CNN Business) Dating app Bumble has been known for setting its own standards for how people should behave on the internet -- from banning shirtless and underwear mirror selfies to photos of guns.

Now, the company is making clear that there is no place for body shaming of any kind on its platform.

"Find something else about their profile to talk about. Or, if you're not interested in someone, you can swipe left," the company said in a blog post this week. "If you're not sure if a message will come across as body shaming, a good rule of thumb is simply not to comment on another user's body or health at all."

Bumble updated its terms and conditions this week to explicitly list "physical appearance" among other discriminatory language it does not tolerate. The list also includes "race, colour, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity."

The updated policy comes as Bumble looks to make its debut on Wall Street . The company filed paperwork earlier this month for an initial public offering. According to the filing, the Bumble dating empire counted 42.1 million monthly active users as of the end of September.
