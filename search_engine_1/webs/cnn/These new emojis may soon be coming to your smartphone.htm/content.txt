(CNN Business) If you've ever wanted to high-five someone in your group texts, you may soon be in luck.

A new "Pushing Hand" gesture that looks like a high-five is on the shortlist of potential new emojis to be released later this year. Also included: a shaking face, a knob of ginger, and a hair pick for styling textured locks.

The draft list also includes maracas, a long-awaited pink heart, and a Khanda, a traditional symbol of the Sikh faith. The possible additions come as pressure has mounted in recent years for emojis to be more inclusive
