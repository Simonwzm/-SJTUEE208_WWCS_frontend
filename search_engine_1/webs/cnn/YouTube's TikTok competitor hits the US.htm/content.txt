(CNN Business) YouTube's TikTok competitor has come to the United States.

On Thursday, the company said it's expanding the beta program for its short-form video offering, called Shorts, to the United States now and over the next several weeks. Previously, it tested the product only in India. Globally, users have been able to view Shorts, but not create them.

YouTube says its feature allows social media creators to "shoot short, catchy videos using nothing but their mobile phones." It offers a way to string multiple clips together, add music, and use a timer and countdown to record videos hands-free, all features currently available on TikTok.

On Thursday, YouTube teased a few new tools it hopes will help it stand out from the pack: Users will be able to sample audio from other Shorts videos and "remix it into your own creation." Creators will also be able to add text to specific points of the video.

YouTube Shorts joins a crowded field of short-form video apps, which are all trying to tap into the craze for bite-sized social media content and capitalize on TikTok's tumultuous year. Instagram has launched Reels in the United States and other countries and Snapchat's Spotlight feature is giving away $1 million a day to the users who make the most entertaining videos. Two of TikTok's rivals in the United States merged earlier this year, while another called Dubsmash was acquired late last year by Reddit.
