London (CNN Business) Message board juggernaut Reddit is accelerating its push into video, snapping up a sharing platform that is popular with young people and women.

Reddit said in a statement on Sunday that it has acquired TikTok rival Dubsmash. It did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.

Dubsmash allows users to create and share video content, and it's especially popular with young, diverse audiences. About 25% of Black teens in the United States use the app. Women make up 70% of Dubsmash users, and roughly 30% of users log in every day, according to Reddit.

The New York-based platform enables more than 1 billion video views per month, Reddit added.

Dubsmash's three co-founders, Suchit Dash, Jonas Dr√ºppel, and Tim Specht, will be joining Reddit with immediate effect. While Dubsmash will maintain its own platform and brand, its video creation tools will be integrated into Reddit, which is best known for its freewheeling message boards.
