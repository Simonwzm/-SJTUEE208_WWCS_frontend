New York (CNN Business) Cyberpunk 2077, the most anticipated game of the year, is finally here. And it's filled with nudity. That would normally be a problem for Twitch, which has a strict policy banning sexual content. But Cyberpunk has climbed up the ranks as one of the most-streamed games on Twitch.

The game, created by Polish gaming company CD Projekt Red, comes packed with its fair share of sexual content, which can be toggled off in settings (it's on by default). The game features suggestive content during character creation, such as genitalia customization and displays nudity throughout various points in the game. That's something that Twitch doesn't normally allow on its platform.

"Nudity and sexually explicit content or activities, such as pornography, sexual acts or intercourse, and sexual services, are prohibited," according to Twitch's community guidelines.

However, Twitch is making an exception for Cyberpunk 2077 streamers.

"Users can play Cyberpunk 2077 on stream provided they progress naturally through things like character customization and do not spend significant periods of time focused on sexual content or nudity," a Twitch spokesperson told CNN Business.
