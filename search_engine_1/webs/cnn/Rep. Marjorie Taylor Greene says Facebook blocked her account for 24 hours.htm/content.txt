(CNN) Facebook has blocked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from posting on its platform for 24 hours, the Georgia Republican said Monday.

The congresswoman reacted to the temporary Facebook ban through her Telegram account, writing, "Facebook has joined Twitter in censoring me."

A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, said Facebook removed one of Greene's posts about Covid-19.
