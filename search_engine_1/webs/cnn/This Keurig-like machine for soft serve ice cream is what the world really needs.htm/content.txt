(CNN Business) It's a rocky road to disrupt the ice cream industry, but sundae you may get your soft serve from a pod.

A new machine called ColdSnap , which looks and functions like a Keurig for soft serve ice cream, has emerged as one of the buzziest products of this year's all-digital CES tech show. At a time when much of the event, like much of our lives, is focused on ways to adapt to the pandemic , the ColdSnap offers the promise of something sweeter, on demand.

The system is marketed as taking shelf-stable, recyclable ice cream pods of varying flavors and freezing them in about 90 seconds before dispensing it into a cup or cone. The company is also working on pods for smoothies, frozen coffees, protein shakes, non-dairy ice cream and frozen cocktails, such as mud slides and daiquiris. The machine reads a QR code on top of the pod's label to find the specific freezing temperature for each product.

The product, which is only in the prototype stage with plans to launch in select locations in the second quarter of 2021 and ship direct to consumers early next year, falls under the where has this been all my life? category. But the price point is less sweet than the product: $1,000. (The company said it aims to eventually bring it down by half.)

Matthew Fonte, the serial entrepreneur behind the product, said it's been a big undertaking to create pods that are safe, convenient (little cleanup), cost effective and sustainable; the pod containers are aluminum like a soda can. Keurig and other one-time use pod makers have long been criticized for the inability to recycle their products.
