(CNN Business) Activision Blizzard's longtime CEO Bobby Kotick is facing mounting pressure from employees to step down amid the company's ongoing sexual harassment scandal.

More than 800 Activision Blizzard workers so far have signed a petition calling for Kotick's resignation. The petition , released on Thursday by a group of employees, says they "no longer have confidence" in Kotick's leadership.

"We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders," the petition added.

Activision Blizzard ATVI — which owns hugely popular titles such as "Call of Duty," "World of Warcraft" and "Candy Crush" — has been roiled by a sexual harassment and discrimination scandal for months and is currently under scrutiny from multiple government agencies.

An Activision Blizzard spokesperson said in response to the petition that the company was "fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment" for its 9,500 employees worldwide.
