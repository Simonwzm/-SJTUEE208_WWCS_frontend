(CNN Business) Uber is reclassifying its 70,000 drivers in the United Kingdom after the UK Supreme Court upheld a ruling last month that they should be classified as workers and not independent contractors.

The company said Tuesday that as "workers" — a classification unique to employment law in the UK that falls short of "employee" — drivers will be entitled to minimum wage, vacation time, and a pension. Uber did not apply the changes to its Uber Eats food delivery workers, only ridehail drivers.

Uber UBER said the minimum wage will be based on engaged time after a trip is accepted and after expenses — a definition that received push back from drivers on Wednesday. The court determined last month that drivers are working from the time they turn on Uber's app, rather than only when transporting passengers as the company has argued.

Uber's policy changes following the ruling mean that "drivers will be still short-changed to the tune of 40-50%," Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, the former drivers who led the legal action against Uber, said in a statement . "While Uber undoubtedly has made progress here, we cannot accept anything less than full compliance with legal minimums," they added.

Last month, the court ruled that a group of Uber drivers that brought a case to an employment tribunal were not independent contractors because their activities were "very tightly defined and controlled by Uber." The judge cited the company's control over fares and how it dictates the contractual terms on which drivers perform their services. Aslam and Farrar filed the suit in 2016 when they were driving for Uber.
