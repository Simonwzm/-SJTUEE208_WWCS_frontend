(CNN) Apple is turning the mask emoji frown upside down in an upcoming update to iOS.

The mask emoji has typically been used to represent someone who is in the medical field or is sick.

However, with masks becoming ubiquitous due to the pandemic, Apple is changing the emoji's look in the upcoming iOS 14.2 update so that it doesn't look quite as sad, according to Emojipedia

Directly comparing the mask emoji to Apple's smiling face emoji, the similarity between the two are obvious. The new mask emoji is essentially the smiling face with a mask on. While it doesn't necessarily mean that it is smiling, the emoji doesn't look quite as cheerless as it does now.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.
