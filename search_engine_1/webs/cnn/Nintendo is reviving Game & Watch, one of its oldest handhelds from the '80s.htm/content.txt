New York (CNN Business) Nintendo is feeling nostalgic lately, and it's reviving a yet another '80s relic.

The Game & Watch portable console, first introduced in 1980 and produced until 1991, was responsible for putting Nintendo on the map. It was a far cry from the Nintendo of today, which regularly puts out best-selling games, connects people online and uses augmented reality with toy cars.

Game & Watch was a series of handheld games that Nintendo sold before the world fell in love with the Game Boy. Back then, the black-and-white Game & Watch only played a single game each.

The new Game & Watch takes the shape of the original with its red and gold design, but charges by USB-C and comes in color. It plays three games: "Super Mario Bros.," "Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels" and "Ball (the Mario version)." Only "Ball," a juggling game, stays in black and white.

Fans of any "Super Mario Bros." game will immediately recognize the iconic music.
