Uber UBER on Tuesday said its revenue hit $8.1 billion during the three months ending in June, more than doubling from the year prior as more customers turn to the ride-hailing service.

The number of consumers and drivers using its platform are "at all-time highs," the company said in its quarterly earnings report. Uber recorded 122 million people using its platform each month, up 21% from the prior year.

Perhaps more stunning for a company with a history of substantial losses is that Uber said it had become cash flow positive, meaning it took in more money from its operations than it spent, excluding capital expenditures, which typically includes property and other physical assets. The company said it generated $382 million in free cash flow during the quarter.
