(CNN Business) Facebook's court-like Oversight Board overturned several of the company's decisions to remove content in its first set of decisions since the independent body began hearing cases last fall.

Facebook FB The board, which has been called's version of a Supreme Court, announced Thursday that it overturned Facebook's decisions in four out of the five cases before it. The cases touched on issues of hate speech, nudity and Covid misinformation.

Facebook's Oversight Board is intended to create a new way for users to appeal content decisions on both Facebook and Instagram, given previous criticism over how the company handles hate speech, violent extremism and graphic materials. The 20-person board includes a former prime minister, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the former editor-in-chief of The Guardian. Facebook says its decisions are final and binding.

All five cases involved Facebook taking down posts for breaking its rules. In one case, Facebook removed a post from a Myanmar user who shared two photos of a Syrian toddler of Kurdish ethnicity who drowned attempting to reach Europe in 2015. The text accompanying the photo, according to the board's description, said there was "something wrong with Muslims (or Muslim men) psychologically or with their mindset." (Myanmar has faced international scrutiny for the persecution against Rohingya Muslims.)

Facebook removed the post due to its hate speech policies. "The Board found that, while the post might be considered pejorative or offensive towards Muslims, it did not advocate hatred or intentionally incite any form of imminent harm. As such, the Board does not consider its removal to be necessary to protect the rights of others," the board posted on its website explaining the decision.
