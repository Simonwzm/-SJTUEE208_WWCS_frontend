Washington (CNN Business) Elon Musk defended his offer to purchase Twitter on Thursday, saying during an on-stage interview at the TED conference that he sees the acquisition as nothing less than a turning point for civilization.

Twitter's TWTR Musk said the proposed deal is not about the economics ofbusiness, but about ensuring Twitter remains a trusted platform for democracy â€” describing his vision in characteristically sweeping terms.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO railed against what he saw as a lack of free speech on Twitter, and said Twitter should open-source its algorithm to increase transparency in the company's content moderation decisions. That would reflect a major shift in how Twitter operates.
