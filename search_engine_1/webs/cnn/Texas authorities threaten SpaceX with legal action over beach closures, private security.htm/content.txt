New York (CNN Business) SpaceX received a warning from a district attorney in Texas this week, warning that the company could be violating several state laws by shutting down public beaches for extended periods of time and using unlicensed security guards to ward people off public roads.

The discrepancy centers on SpaceX's activities in South Texas, where the company has taken over large plots of land near Boca Chica Beach in order to build and test massive rocket prototypes of the rocket that CEO Elon Musk envisions will one day carry the first humans to Mars.

The frequent road closures and traffic jams SpaceX has brought to the area, as well as the explosive rocket testing mishaps that have littered the local beaches with shrapnel, have often rubbed local residents and environmental activists the wrong way. Now, the district attorney of Cameron County, which encompasses Boca Chica Beach, is warning SpaceX that its actions could make the company and, possibly, employees "subject to arrest and prosecution," according to a June 11 letter obtained by CNN Business.

The contents of the letter were first reported by local television station KRGV.

In the note, Cameron County district attorney Luis Saenz alleged that members of his staff, while investigating complaints from a resident about the behavior of SpaceX's private security personnel on June 9, encountered a man wearing a "tactical bulletproof vest" who "approached, stopped and detained" them for attempting to access a public roadway near SpaceX's manufacturing facilities.
