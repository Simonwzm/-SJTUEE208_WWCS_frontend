New York (CNN Business) Federal regulators made a key decision on SpaceX's plans to launch its gargantuan Mars rocket, called Starship, into orbit from Texas â€” saying Monday that, as long as the company complies with 75 "mitigating actions," the rocket launches should clear federal standards for environmental impact.

The list of actions includes enlisting a "qualified biologist" to monitor the impact on local wildlife; warning the public ahead of launches about the loud sonic booms and possible dangers; and agreeing to clean up any shrapnel from the launches in "sensitive habitats." The company also has to agree to not launch on major holidays and a limited number of weekends so that the public can maintain access to a nearby beach.

But the key piece of the Federal Aviation Administration's announcement was that it determined SpaceX's launch plans "would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment." As a result, the agency isn't requiring a more thorough review that could further hamstring the company's plans.

The environmental review approval, however, doesn't guarantee that the FAA will give SpaceX a launch license, which will involve a safety and risk assessment. That's still under review.

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
