New York (CNN Business) The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation named four new members to its board of trustees on Wednesday, marking the first outsiders added to the charity's board in its two-decade history.

The new additions, which include a billionaire, a baroness and the CEO of the Gates Foundation, are being brought on in part to help bolster the foundation's governance in the wake of Bill and Melinda French Gates' divorce last year.

Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, wrote in a letter that the new appointments will "provide additional input, strategic guidance, and fiduciary oversight to the foundation," and that the decision "represents an explicit recognition by Bill and Melinda, especially in the wake of their divorce, that the foundation will be well served by the addition of strong, independent voices to help shape our governance."

In addition to Suzman, the new board members include Strive Masiyiwa, the billionaire founder of technology company Econet Group; Baroness Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, director of the London School of Economics and Political Science; Thomas Tierney, the co-founder of philanthropic consulting firm Bridgespan Group and former chief executive of Bain & Co.

The charity has had no trustees beside Bill and Melinda French Gates since Bill Gates Sr.'s death in 2020 and Warren Buffett's resignation in June 2021 after 15 years on the board. Buffett did not specify his reasons for leaving the foundation, but noted at the time that he had resigned from all corporate boards other than Berkshire Hathaway's.
