(CNN Business) In the early months of the pandemic, people clamored for an invite to Clubhouse's audio-only app to hear the musings of a who's who of venture capitalists, tech leaders and celebrities. Now, Clubhouse is opening up to everyone at a time when there are questions about the app's staying power.

Clubhouse, where members join virtual rooms to have live, unscripted discussions, said Wednesday that it will no longer be invite-only or operate a waitlist to join the app. All iOS and Android users in the United States and abroad can now sign up.

The platform launched in March 2020 as the pandemic hit the United States and many were stuck at home. It swiftly became the talk of Silicon Valley and caught the attention of larger social networks. By January 2021, Clubhouse was reportedly valued at $1 billion.

Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth said in a January blog post that they planned to "scale ... as fast as we can and open it up to everyone soon." An Android version of the app, launched in May, has surpassed 10 million downloads, the company said Wednesday.

"The invite system has been an important part of our early history," Davison and Seth wrote in a blog post Wednesday. They also said adding people in waves has helped to "grow Clubhouse in a measured way."
