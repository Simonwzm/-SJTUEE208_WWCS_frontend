Washington (CNN Business) Bill Gates sounded a note of caution this week on Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, saying the Tesla CEO "actually could make it worse" despite a strong track record with his other business ventures.

"If all you need is money and hiring great engineers, he's probably as good a person as any" to guide Twitter through its next chapter, Gates added, but said he doesn't expect Musk to replicate Tesla and SpaceX's "mind-blowing" performance.
