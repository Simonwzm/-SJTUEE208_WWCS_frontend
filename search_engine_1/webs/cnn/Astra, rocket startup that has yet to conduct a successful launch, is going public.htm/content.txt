Austin, Texas (CNN Business) Astra, a US-based rocket startup aiming to build cheap rockets to haul satellites to space, announced Tuesday that it's going public via a reverse merger known as SPAC.

The company has yet to begin commercial operations, and though a December test launch of its Rocket 3.2 came very close to entering Earth's orbit, Astra has not yet conducted a fully successful test launch.

Holicity HOL But— a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), or a " blank check " investing tool, created by Craig McCaw who made a fortune in the telecom business — is planning to acquire the company.

That means McCaw is placing a multibillion-dollar bet that Astra will make good on its pledge to rapidly build lightweight rockets that can safely launch satellites. If shareholders approve of the proposed merger, the deal could be finalized in the second quarter of 2021, and Astra will begin trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol "ASTR."

SPACs have become increasingly popular over the past year. With a SPAC, a blank-check firm allows companies to skip the time-consuming and expensive process of raising money through a more traditional initial public offering. Going the SPAC route will also allow Astra to skip many of the financial disclosures required of more traditional IPOs.
