London (CNN Business) Neuralink, the implant company owned by SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, has released a video in which a monkey appears to play the computer game Pong using only its mind.

The nine-year old male macaque, named Pager, has a Neuralink device implanted in both sides of its brain, according to a YouTube video posted by the company on Friday.

Neuralink is developing Bluetooth-enabled implantable chips that can communicate with computers via a small receiver, and has previously demonstrated the technology in pigs.

"He's learned to interact with a computer for a tasty banana smoothie delivered through a straw," says the narrator in the video as Pager moves an onscreen cursor using a joystick.

The two Neuralink devices record brain activity via more than 2,000 tiny electrodes implanted in Pager's motor cortex, which controls hand and arm movements, according to the video.
