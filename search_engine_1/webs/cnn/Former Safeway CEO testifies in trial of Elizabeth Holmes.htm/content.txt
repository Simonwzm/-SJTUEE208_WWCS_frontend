(CNN Business) Former Safeway CEO Steven Burd testified Wednesday during the criminal trial of Elizabeth Holmes about his company's decision to invest heavily in a partnership with her blood testing startup Theranos that ultimately failed to get off the ground.

Burd, who served as CEO of the grocery chain from 1993 to 2013, said he was drawn to Theranos for its promise of being able to conduct blood tests faster, cheaper and without the need of a full laboratory. Burd said he saw the potential for customers to get their blood tests done while shopping and to use that service to bring more customers into Safeway stores.

"It was a fascinating concept," Burd said in his testimony, saying that the blood testing device he was shown was about the size of a "large bagel toaster" and that he was told the turnaround time on results could be just 20 to 30 minutes. As he put it, "we were consistently told that it essentially replaces a traditional full blown lab."

Holmes and Theranos touted the promise of using their proprietary device to test for a conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood taken by a finger stick. Holmes catapulted her startup to a $9 billion valuation and secured key retail partnerships with both Safeway and Walgreens. Then, the dominoes started to fall after a 2015 investigation into its testing methods and capabilities by the Wall Street Journal.

Safeway invested hundreds of millions of dollars into building out clinics in 800 of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, but reportedly dissolved its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.
