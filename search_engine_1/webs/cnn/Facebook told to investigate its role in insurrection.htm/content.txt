(CNN Business) Facebook's independent oversight board on Wednesday upheld the company's decision to suspend former President Donald Trump. But one of the most important aspects of the decision wasn't really about the former President's social media accounts at all; instead it was a recommendation for a deeper review of the role the platform played in the spread of election conspiracy theories that, in the board's words, "exacerbated tensions that culminated in the violence in the United States on January 6."

The board said the review should "be an open reflection on the design and policy choices that Facebook has made that may allow its platform to be abused."

The company has attempted to distance itself from the idea that its platform played a role in the insurrection, so the recommendation that it reckon with its culpability in election misinformation and violence may not be one it welcomes.

Speaking soon after the insurrection in January, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg sought to downplay her company's role in fueling it â€” and suggested that other technology platforms were largely to blame.

While Facebook does have more rules and more content moderators than other platforms, election conspiracy theories still flourished on its platforms.
