(CNN Business) If your Tuesday morning started out with internet connectivity problems, it's not just you.

Comcast customers in various areas across the United States, including parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois, reported outages early Tuesday with their Xfinity internet service. Outage tracking service Downdetector recorded more than 52,000 outage reports around 9 a.m. ET, with most complaining of a "total blackout" of service.

In response to one tweet Tuesday morning, the company's verified Xfinity Support Twitter account acknowledged "widespread interruptions to the XFINITY Services," which it said was "due to unforeseen circumstances." In response to another tweet, the account said : "We are currently having connection concerns around the nation, our network team is working hard toward a resolution."

Some users reported issues connecting to Xfinity's status center webpage, which shows where issues might be occurring.

"Some customers are experiencing intermittent service interruptions as a result of a network issue," a tweet from the Xfinity account sent around 11 a.m. ET read. "Our teams are actively working to bring impacted customers back online, as we continue to investigate. We apologize to those who have been affected."
