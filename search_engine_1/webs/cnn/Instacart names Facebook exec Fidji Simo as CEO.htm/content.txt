(CNN) Instacart has tapped one of the top female executives from Facebook to be its next CEO ahead of a possible Wall Street debut.

Fidji Simo, who served most recently as a vice president and head of the Facebook App, will replace Instacart's cofounder Apoorva Mehta as chief executive of the fast-growing grocery delivery service. The hire makes Simo the rare female CEO of a large on-demand delivery company, and one that is reportedly making moves to go public

In a letter to the Instacart community Thursday announcing the news, Mehta said Simo was "at Facebook during its transition from a private company to the public market and understands what it takes to lead and scale a transformational company."

"I believe that with Fidji at the helm we'll be in an even stronger position to realize our full potential and I look forward to working with her in our journey ahead," said Mehta, who will transition into the role of executive chairman of the board.

Simo, who joined Instacart's board earlier this year and will officially begin as CEO on August 2, will be inheriting a company that has experienced a tremendous surge in customer and investor demand from the pandemic. The company, which was valued at $39 billion in March, saw its valuation double twice since the pandemic began.
