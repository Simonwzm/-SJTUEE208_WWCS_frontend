(CNN Business) Facebook said Wednesday it will now remove content that urges Americans to report to the polls as unauthorized poll watchers if that content uses "militarized language" or when the intent behind the posts is to intimidate voters.

Posts that use the word "army" or "battle" or that are implicitly threatening would fall under the ban, said Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, on a call with reporters.
