(CNN Business) Early in the pandemic, Jane Cox Childress brought her teenage son warm cookies at his desk during a remote learning session. She received a text message in response: "Mom, could you please not bring me anything when I'm in class?"

Childress said she "learned quickly to be more respectful when he was in class." After that, the two started exchanging a constant stream of texts throughout the day as they continued to do their respective work remotely: Are you ready for lunch? Is this your last class? Here's a heart emoji or two.

"It reminds me of the olden days when I was a teenager. Some of my friends with fancy houses had intercoms," Childress said. "We use texting a lot like that now. It beats yelling up and down the stairs."

A lot has been written about how technology has allowed us to feel closer to people outside our quarantine bubbles during the pandemic. But a number of people are also finding that texting and other chat tools can help create some much-needed distance from their loved ones under the same roof. For those who lean on texts at home, the benefits are both psychological -- as we spend 24/7 in close proximity talking face-to-face with the same few people -- and logistical, as family members confront the realities of effectively being coworkers.

Texts give people the opportunity to slow down, be reflective and say what they mean without becoming too reactive, psychologists say. Sending texts is also a way to honor the multiple roles someone has in the home right now without interrupting those functions -- a mother or father may also be a full-time remote employee, while a child might be a virtual student. Texting can help preserve some sense of separate quarters during the long and messy remote workdays.
