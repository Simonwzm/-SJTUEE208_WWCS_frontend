New York (CNN Business) The US military is racking up deals with commercial rocket companies to explore the idea of using rockets typically tasked with launching satellites or astronauts to shuttle military cargo around the world at record speeds.

The companies so far tapped to join the military in exploring ways to bring that idea to fruition include Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, and, most recently, Rocket Lab, according to a Tuesday press release

Essentially, the lineup is a who's-who of the commercial "new space" sector â€” relatively young rocket companies that are already shaking up the business of getting satellites to orbit at cheaper price points.

But these deals with the military are something different. Rather than rockets leaving their freight in Earth's orbit, this program aims to use them to get weapons, supplies or perhaps even people from one country to another at speeds far surpassing that of other types of transportation.
