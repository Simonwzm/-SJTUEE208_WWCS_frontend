Google's parent company reported revenues of $55.3 billion for the first three months of the year — a 34% jump from the same period last year — and made close to $18 billion in profit, comfortably blowing past analyst estimates. It also announced a $50 billion stock buyback.

The company's stock jumped nearly 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.

Google GOOG "Over the last year, people have turned toSearch and many online services to stay informed, connected and entertained," Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement Wednesday.

Google's cloud business, which the company has increasingly leaned on to diversify from its core advertising revenue, trimmed its losses to $974 million from $1.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue from cloud increased 46% year over year, to $4 billion.
