(CNN Business) If the "Spring loaded" tagline of Apple's upcoming press event is any indication, the company is about to drop a ton of new products.

Apple AAPL is hosting its first event of 2021 on Tuesday and it'll likely focus on new iPads, along with a product that's been years in the making.

Apple's event kicks off at 1:00 pm ET/10:00 am PT on its website, YouTube and Apple TV.

The invitations for the virtual press conference sent to reporters last week included an image of colorful spirals that form the Apple logo â€” a picture potentially made to look as if it had been produced by an Apple Pencil, a clue hinting at updates to its iPad line.

The company's invitations are often filled with red herrings, but Apple senior marketing executive Greg Joswiak added to the fodder when he tweeted a video featuring an animation of the spirals bouncing around Apple's campus. It sparked speculation that augmented reality could also be part of the company's presentation.
