New York (CNN Business) Facebook acknowledged to shareholders this week that it is facing "government investigations" related to the tens of thousands of pages of internal company documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen.

"Beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being," the company said in its quarterly earnings filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The filing did not specify whether the government "investigations and requests" refer to known inquiries by the US Senate and UK Parliament, or to previously unconfirmed probes from federal agencies in the United States and from governments abroad.

Facebook declined to provide specifics on the disclosure. "We are always ready to answer regulators' questions and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries," spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business.

On Tuesday night, Facebook sent out a "legal hold" to its employees, telling them to not to delete any internal documents and communications, Facebook spokesperson Genevieve Grdina told CNN. "Document preservation requests are part of the process of responding to legal inquiries," she said in a statement. (The New York Times was first to report the news.)
