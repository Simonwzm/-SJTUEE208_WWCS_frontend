New York (CNN Business) "The shift over time of election results as different types of ballots are fully counted is my biggest source of concern right now," one employee who works on countering misinformation for a major social media platform said on Saturday. "If it isn't a landslide one way or the other, every race that leans one direction and goes another is a potential flashpoint for offline violence."

The days -- and possibly weeks -- after Election Day will be a huge test for platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google's YouTube. Doctored videos that could potentially be spread by anyone; fake accounts that could pop up anywhere; and tweets from President Trump himself could all contribute to undermining the result of the election and perhaps even stoke offline violence.

CNN Business spoke to more than a dozen people who are either employees at the major social media platforms working on the teams countering misinformation and extremism or people who work directly with those teams at the companies.

CNN Business granted them anonymity so they could speak about their work more freely.
