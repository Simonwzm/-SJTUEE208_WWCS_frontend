(CNN Business) Russia and Iran are the top two sources of coordinated fake activity on Facebook (FB), according to a new report released by the company.

Facebook's report , published Wednesday, shows how foreign and domestic covert influence operators have shifted their tactics and grown more sophisticated in response to efforts by social media companies to crack down on fake accounts and influence operations.

Facebook has removed more than 150 networks of coordinated fake activity since 2017, the report said. Twenty-seven networks have been linked to Russia, and 23 to Iran. Nine originated within the United States.

The US remains the primary target for foreign influence campaigns, Facebook's report said, highlighting 26 such efforts by a variety of sources from 2017 to 2020. (Ukraine follows as a distant second.)
