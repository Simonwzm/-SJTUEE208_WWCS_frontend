New York (CNN Business) Facebook said it's no longer removing from its platforms claims that coronavirus was man-made.

In a statement to CNN Business, a Facebook spokesperson said late Wednesday that, "In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made from our apps."
