(CNN Business) Lyft has agreed to a $25 million settlement with shareholders over allegations that it failed to adequately disclose threats to its reputation and business ahead of going public.

The "misstatements and omissions" before its initial public offering include not disclosing the "existential risk" presented by reports of drivers assaulting passengers on the platform, as well as safety issues concerning its bikeshare business.
