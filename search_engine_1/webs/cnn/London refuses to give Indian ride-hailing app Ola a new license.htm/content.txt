London (CNN Business) London transport officials have refused to grant a new license to Ola over safety concerns, saying the Indian ride-hailing app is not "fit and proper to hold one."

Transport for London said in a statement on Sunday that unlicensed vehicles and drivers had made more than 1,000 trips on the app, and that Ola had failed to notify the regulator of the breaches when they were first identified.

"Our duty as a regulator is to ensure passenger safety," said Helen Chapman, the director of licensing, regulation and charging at Transport for London. "We will closely scrutinize the company to ensure passenger safety is not compromised."

Ola is one of several apps including Bolt, Kapten and ViaVan to challenge Uber and traditional black cabs in the lucrative urban market . It said in a statement that it would appeal the decision. The app will be allowed to continue operating in London during the appeals process.

Marc Rozendal, the startup's UK managing director, said that "our core principle is to work closely, collaboratively and transparently with regulators."
