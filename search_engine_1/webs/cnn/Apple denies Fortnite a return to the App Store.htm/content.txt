(CNN Business) Apple will not allow Fortnite back on its devices until its legal battle with the video game's maker, Epic Games, has fully concluded, potentially delaying the game's return to iPhones by several years.

Apple AAPL A lawyer forsaid the company "has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic's developer program account at this time" in response to a request from the video game maker to do so, according to a letter sent to Epic's lawyer and tweeted by the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney, on Wednesday.

"Furthermore, Apple will not consider any requests for reinstatement until the district court's judgment becomes final and non-appealable," said the letter from Apple's lawyer, a copy of which was provided to CNN Business by Epic.

The move further escalates a months-long court battle between the two companies over Apple's rules for its App Store and suggests the hugely popular game won't make it back onto iOS devices until the end of an appeals process. Sweeney said in a tweet that process could take as long as five years.

A judge in California ruled earlier this month that Apple can no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside the App Store. However, the judge stopped short of declaring the iPhone maker a monopoly and ruled that it was within its rights to remove Fortnite from its devices. Epic has appealed the decision.
