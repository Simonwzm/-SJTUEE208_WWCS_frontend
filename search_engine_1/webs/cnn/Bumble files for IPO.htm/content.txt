(CNN Business) Bumble, the company best known for its female-centered dating app, is getting ready for its big date with Wall Street.

The company filed paperwork on Friday for an initial public offering, potentially setting it up for a Wall Street debut at a time when dating apps have become lifelines for single people during the pandemic.

It will list on the Nasdaq under the stock ticker "BMBL."

The company reported generating $376.6 million in revenue between Jan. 29 and Sept. 30 of last year. During that same period, the company posted a net loss of $84.1 million.

Bumble was founded in 2014 by Whitney Wolfe Herd, who started her career at Tinder. She initially set out to create a women-focused social network before landing on the concept of a female-focused dating app. Bumble requires women searching for heterosexual matches to make the first move, the idea being that this feature would empower women to make their own choices. It took off: Bumble, headquartered in Austin, has become a household name and now includes services beyond dating, including professional networking (Bumble Bizz) and finding new friends (Bumble BFF).
