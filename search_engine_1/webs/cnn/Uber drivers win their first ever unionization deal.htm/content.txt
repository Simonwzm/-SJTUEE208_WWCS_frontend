London (CNN Business) Uber has recognized a labor union for the first time in a move that could boost efforts by gig economy workers to win better employment rights.

GMB, one of Britain's largest unions, will now be able to represent up to 70,000 drivers across the United Kingdom — one of Uber's most important international markets — according to a joint statement from the union and the company.

"This groundbreaking deal between GMB and Uber could be the first step to a fairer working life for millions of people," said GMB's national officer Mick Rix. "We now call on all other operators to follow suit," Rix added.

Uber UBER is the only major private taxi operator to offer these protections, according to GMB, which could give it an advantage over other app-based services such as Bolt and Ola by making it a more attractive employer. British union Unite represents London's Black Cab drivers.

"Whilst Uber and GMB may not seem like obvious allies, we've always agreed that drivers must come first, and today we have struck this important deal to improve workers' protections," said Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe.
