(CNN Business) Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO and world's richest man, welcomed twins last year with an executive at one of his other companies, Neuralink, Insider reported on Wednesday.

Musk, who posted a tweet on May 24 saying "USA birth rate has been below min sustainable levels for ~50 years" and pinned it to the top of his more than 100 million-follower Twitter account, quietly fathered the children with Shivon Zilis, who works for Musk at the company which hopes to develop an implantable computer chip for the human brain, according to documents obtained by Insider.

The outlet obtained court filings pertaining to changing the children's legal names to incorporate the Musk last name, and Zilis' as part of the middle names. CNN Business could not independently confirm the contents of the documents, but a Travis County, Texas court docket obtained by CNN Business indicated that the name change petition was initially filed in April 2022 and granted in early May â€” matching the dates on the documents published by Insider. Those documents contain the court's stamp as well as Musk's signature, listing him as the father and Zilis as the mother.

Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent to representatives at Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink.

On Thursday morning, Musk appeared to acknowledge the story on Twitter by reiterating his stance about birth rates. "Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis," he tweeted. "A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far."
