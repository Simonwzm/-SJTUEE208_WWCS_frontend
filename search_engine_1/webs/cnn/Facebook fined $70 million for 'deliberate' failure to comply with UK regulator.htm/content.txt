London (CNN Business) The UK competition regulator has slapped Facebook (FB) with a $70 million fine for repeatedly ignoring warnings and deliberately breaking its rules.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in a statement Wednesday that Facebook had "consciously" refused to report all the required information during an investigation of the tech giant's acquisition of online database Giphy

The regulator issued an "initial enforcement order" related to the takeover in June 2020, requiring the companies to compete against each other as usual and halt any integration efforts during the investigation.

Facebook was required to provide the regulator with regular updates about its compliance. The tech giant "significantly limited the scope of those updates," the CMA said Wednesday, "despite repeated warnings." The regulator said it had concluded that Facebook's "failure to comply was deliberate."

The CMA said this is the first time a company has breached an initial enforcement order by "consciously refusing to report all the required information." The Â£50.5 million ($70 million) fine is 155 times greater than the previous record for this type of breach.
