(CNN Business) When Uber let go of thousands of workers as part of pandemic-related layoffs earlier this year, it led to a decline in overall Black representation within its workforce, the company said in its annual diversity report on Friday.

Uber UBER Earlier this year,cut about 25% of its workforce, or roughly 6,700 employees , as it grappled with the drastic decline in its ride-hail business due to the coronavirus. Those layoffs included thousands of its customer support employees, which resulted in a noticeable dent in Black representation at Uber, underscoring how the diverse team helped buoy the company's overall metric.

Uber reported a 1.8 percentage point decline in Black representation, which now makes up 7.5% of its overall US workforce, down from 9.3% in 2019.

"Despite the continued progress we have made in increasing the diversity of our leadership, we're not proud of the impact that this year's reorganization has had on some of our workforce representation," said Uber's chief diversity officer Bo Young Lee in a statement to CNN Business. "We know we must always work to do better and remain laser focused on becoming an anti-racist company and a champion for equity."

Uber said it took measures to mitigate bias in its downsizing efforts, noting that it had external counsel conduct an analysis based on protected classes as part of the process. When asked by CNN Business, it declined to provide a racial or gender breakdown of the layoffs.
