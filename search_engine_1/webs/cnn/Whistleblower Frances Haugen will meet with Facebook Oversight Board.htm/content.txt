New York (CNN Business) Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen will meet with the social network's independent court-like oversight board in the coming weeks to discuss her concerns about the company, the Facebook Oversight Board said Monday.

Facebook FB Haugen has set off a firestorm around the social media giant in recent weeks after she leaked thousands of pages of documents to lawmakers and the Wall Street Journal. Earlier this month, the 37-year-old formerproduct manager revealed her identity on "60 Minutes" in an interview in which she said Facebook has repeatedly prioritized profits over public good. In a Senate subcommittee hearing last week, Haugen detailed a range of concerns, including that the company knows it is serving harmful, eating disorder-related content to young users and that the use of Facebook by authoritarian leaders could present national security concerns.

"In light of the serious claims made about Facebook by Ms. Haugen, we have extended an invitation for her to speak to the Board over the coming weeks, which she has accepted," the Oversight Board said in a release Monday. "Board members appreciate the chance to discuss Ms. Haugen's experiences and gather information that can help push for greater transparency and accountability from Facebook through our case decisions and recommendations."

Haugen confirmed on Twitter Monday that she had accepted the invitation to "brief the Facebook Oversight Board about what I learned while working there." She added: "Facebook has lied to the board repeatedly, and I am looking forward to sharing the truth with them."

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.
