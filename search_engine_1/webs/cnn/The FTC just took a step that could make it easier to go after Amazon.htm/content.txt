(CNN Business) For years, the US antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission have pledged only to go after companies that have harmed consumers. Now, under its new chair Lina Khan, the FTC is expanding its approach in a move that could make it easier to go after tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) that may offer attractive prices to customers, but have also been accused of harming small businesses, workers and innovation.

The FTC on Thursday voted 3-2 to rescind a 2015 policy document that restricted how officials could bring cases against alleged antitrust violators, meaning more corporate conduct could become subject to FTC investigations and lawsuits.

The 2015 policy statement, a voluntary commitment by the Obama-era FTC, assured the public that the agency would prioritize "consumer welfare" in its enforcement decisions. The FTC at the time also pledged to consider "business justifications" that might offset alleged harms to competition, in what amounted to a series of self-imposed limits on the scope of FTC authority.

By moving to undo those limitations, Khan has sent a powerful signal that regulators may soon more heavily scrutinize business practices whose allegedly harmful effects go beyond impacts to consumer prices. Conduct that harms innovation or workers could see renewed attention, said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the consumer group Public Knowledge and a former FTC official.

That could be bad news for Amazon. Various critics of the company have decried how the e-commerce giant allegedly mistreats its drivers and warehouse employees, abuses its market dominance in e-commerce and restricts innovation by dominating the smart home speaker market.
