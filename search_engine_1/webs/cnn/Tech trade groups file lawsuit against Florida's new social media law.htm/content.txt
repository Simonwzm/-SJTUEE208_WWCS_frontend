(CNN Business) Florida's new law prohibiting social media platforms from suspending politicians is just days old. But it's already being challenged in court by the tech industry.

On Thursday, a pair of technology trade groups filed a legal challenge to SB 7072, the hot-button legislation signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this week that promises stiff fines against tech companies that "de-platform" political candidates in the state by banning or suspending them. The legislation also gives private Florida residents the ability to sue tech companies who violate the law.

Calling the legislation a "blatant attack" on the First Amendment rights of private businesses, the trade groups urged a federal court to declare SB 7072 unconstitutional and unenforceable.

The lawsuit filed by NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association — both of which count Facebook, Google and Twitter as members — alleges that the legislation unlawfully forces tech companies to host content they might otherwise prohibit under their platform policies.

"No one, not even someone who has paid a filing fee to run for office, has a First Amendment right to compel a private actor to carry speech on their private property," reads the complaint , which was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida.
