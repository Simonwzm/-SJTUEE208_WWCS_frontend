New York (CNN Business) Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire, arrived at the International Space Station this morning after soaring into outer space aboard a Russian-built Soyuz capsule, kicking off the first self-funded tourism mission to the International Space Station in a decade.

The capsule took off from Russia's Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2:38 am ET Wednesday, and docked with the ISS right on schedule at 8:41 am ET.

Joining Maezawa on his 12-day journey aboard the ISS are veteran Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin, who will command the mission, and Maezawa's production assistant, and videographer Yozo Hirano, who will capture footage of the fashion mogul as he floats around the orbiting space station.

"I'm so curious 'what's life like in space'? So, I am planning to find out on my own and share with the world on my YouTube channel," Maezawa said in a recent statement

This mission exemplifies the drastic shift the global space industry has taken in the past decade. Such space tourism missions have happened before â€” namely eight similar missions for wealthy thrill seekers launched to the ISS in the 2000s, all organized aboard Soyuz capsules by US-based company Space Adventures. But such missions took a hiatus after NASA's Space Shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving Russia's Soyuz spacecraft as the only option for transporting even professional astronauts to the ISS.
