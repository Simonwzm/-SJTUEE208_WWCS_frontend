(CNN Business) Apple isn't done with 2020 yet.

The company on Monday announced another launch event — its third in recent months — scheduled for November 10. An invite sent to reporters was simply titled "One More Thing," a line Apple often deploys at the end of big events to debut a surprise product.

Apple AAPL The invitation did not give any hints about whatplans to reveal, but there is one product the company has previously teased but hasn't yet released.

At its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, Apple announced it would soon start using its own silicon chips in its Mac computer lineup, switching away from the ones made by Intel that the devices have used for years. Apple said the first Macs with the new chips would begin rolling out by the end of this year.

Apple gave no hints about what it will reveal during the upcoming event, teased with the tag line "One more thing."

The ARM-based chips, which Apple designs in-house and already uses a version of in iPhones and iPads, will likely enable better battery life and more seamless integration across devices, analysts say.
