(CNN Business) Google is tapping out of the super-expensive smartphone race.

Google GOOGL With its latest line of Pixel devices, announced in an online event Wednesday,appears to be targeting a more cost-conscious user than the premium smartphones from competitors such as Apple and Samsung â€” many of which cost upwards of $1,000 and some as much as $2,000 . The Pixel 5 starts at $699 and the Pixel 4a 5G starts at $499. Meanwhile, the Pixel 4a that launched earlier this year costs $399.

Those lower prices do come with some sacrifices. Both Pixel phones have less powerful processors and displays than the top devices from Samsung and Apple, and the Pixel 4a 5G is not waterproof, though the Pixel 5 is.

Japan will be the first country to get the Pixel 4a 5G on October 15, with the phone set to launch in eight other countries, including the United States, in November. The Pixel 5 will launch in eight countries on October 15 and in the United States on October 29.

Both of Google's new phones support 5G, the next generation of super-fast wireless networks . They are the latest in a growing slate of phones on the market built to connect to 5G, including models from Motorola, Samsung, Huawei, LG and others. Apple is widely expected to launch its own 5G-enabled phone next month.
