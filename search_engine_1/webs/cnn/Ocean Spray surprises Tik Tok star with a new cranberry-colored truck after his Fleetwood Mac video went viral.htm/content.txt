(CNN) Ocean Spray is giving back after a TikTok video featuring one of their products exploded online.

The video, posted by Nathan Apodaca -- perhaps better known to some as 420doggface208 -- was as simple as it comes: He rides a long board down the road, drinking Ocean Spray, while lip-syncing to Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams."

It wasn't fancy, it wasn't crazy, but everyone went wild for the Idaho man's vibe. Even Mick Fleetwood posted his own version of the video as the first post on his TikTok account

But there was a reason Apodaca was on that board -- his car broke down and he had to get to work.

"My car shuts off from time to time, and it shut off down the highway... I didn't want to wait to flag someone down to get a jump. So I grabbed my juice and grabbed my board," he told CNN on Wednesday. He added that it wasn't necessarily an uncommon experience.
