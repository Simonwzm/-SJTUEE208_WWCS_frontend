(CNN Business) Facebook announced Tuesday that it is shutting down its standalone Gaming App this fall.

The app for video gamers and live-streamers, which has long struggled to compete with rivals like Amazon-owned Twitch, will no longer work on Oct. 28, according to a notice posted in the app on Tuesday. Beginning on that date, the Facebook Gaming App for iOS and Android will also no longer be available on app stores.

"We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to all of you for everything you've done to build a thriving community for gamers and fans since this app first launched," the memo, signed by The Facebook Gaming team, stated. "This was a truly a community-led effort to bring new gaming features to Facebook."

A spokesperson for Facebook-parent Meta confirmed the news in a statement to CNN Business on Tuesday, but added, "people will still be able to find their games, streamers, and groups on the main Facebook app."
