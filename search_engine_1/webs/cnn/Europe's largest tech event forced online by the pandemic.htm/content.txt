London (CNN Business) Europe's largest technology conference will be held entirely online this year, as the coronavirus pandemic forces scores of major events to go digital.

The organizers of Web Summit said in a statement on Thursday that the decision followed discussions with the Portuguese government and city of Lisbon.

"Lisbon is still Web Summit's home but with growing Covid-19 outbreaks across Europe, we have to think of what's best for the people of Portugal and our attendees," said the conference's founder Paddy Cosgrave. "The safest and most reasonable answer is to host Web Summit fully online in 2020. We look forward to welcoming attendees back to Lisbon in 2021," he added.

Web Summit is the latest major event to be forced online, canceled or postponed, as a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe prompts several governments to tighten restrictions and implement localized lockdowns. More than 70,000 people attended the tech gathering last year from 163 countries.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) said on Wednesday that its annual meeting of world leaders and CEOs, typically held in January in Davos, will instead take place in Lucerne in May. But that will only happen if the health and safety of participants can be guaranteed.
