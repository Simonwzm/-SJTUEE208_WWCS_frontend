New York (CNN Business) Boeing managed to dock a spacecraft at the International Space Station late last week, but it was not without several minor hangups.

The mission kicked off Thursday evening with a Florida launch, and the Starliner — which is designed to carry astronauts but is flying without people for this test — docked with the ISS Friday night at 8:28 pm ET. The docking occurred about an hour later than expected as ground crews worked through a few issues, including a software issue that skewed graphics, sort of like a misaligned GPS map. There were also issues with sensors and some docking components that were not initially moving correctly.

The capsule has a docking ring that pops out as it approaches its port and is used to latch on to the ISS. During the first attempt at docking, some components didn't move into the proper configuration. Ground teams had to try the pop-out process a second time to get everything in the right place. There had also been a small problem with the Starliner's cooling loops, which are part of the system that regulates the spacecraft's temperature.

All those issues had to be analyzed or fixed in time for the Starliner to move ahead, and the docking ultimately went off without a major issue.

"It was really nail-biting watching that vehicle sit out there for a while until it was it was time to come in," Mark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program manager, told reporters Friday night.
