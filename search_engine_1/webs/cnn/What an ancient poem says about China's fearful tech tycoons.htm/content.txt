Hong Kong (CNN Business) A thousand-year-old poem just cost Chinese delivery giant Meituan tens of billions of dollars in market value, further rattling a tech industry that is already on edge.

The firestorm erupted after Meituan founder and CEO Wang Xing posted a poem from the Tang dynasty era on social media last Thursday.

Wang's original post on the website Fanfou has since been deleted. But Meituan confirmed to CNN Business that it contained the poem "The Book Burning Pit," written by Chinese poet Zhang Jie more than 1,100 years ago to satirize Qin Shi Huang, who proclaimed himself the first "emperor" of a unified China in 221 BC.

According to official historical records in China, Qin quashed dissent by digging huge pits and burning books that were not approved by his government, and well as burying scholars to discourage people from critiquing his rule.

"It's just wishful thinking that Qin Shi Huang expects to rely on force to maintain his and his descendants' rule on China forever," the poem reads in part. "The ashes in the pits haven't turned cold yet. But there are already riots in Shandong," it adds, referring to a major seat of power at the time.
