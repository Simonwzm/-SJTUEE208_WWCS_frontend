New York (CNN Business) Hours after the Supreme Court refused to block a Texas law prohibiting most abortions on Wednesday night, a small group of leaders at rideshare company Lyft convened to discuss how the company would respond.

Lyft LYFT "Our President and CEO, John Zimmer and Logan Green, reached out and said, 'What can we do about this?'"General Counsel Kristin Sverchek told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday. "Very quickly, we decided we wanted to act."

The company had begun hearing from drivers concerned about the possibility that they could be sued under the new law. The Texas law prohibits abortion providers from conducting abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows individuals to take civil action against anyone, not just medical providers, who "aids or abets" a restricted abortion, which legal experts say could include rideshare drivers who give a person a ride to an abortion procedure, potentially whether or not the driver knows that is what's happening.

"We both wanted to come out strongly in support of a woman's right to choose, as well as to make our drivers feel okay," Sverchek said. "We did not want them being in this untenable position for not knowing whether their behavior was okay or not."

Uber UBER On Friday, Green, Lyft's CEO, announced that the company would create a legal defense fund to protect any drivers sued under the law for driving a person who receives an abortion. Shortly afterward,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi followed suit and said his company would provide similar protections for its drivers.
