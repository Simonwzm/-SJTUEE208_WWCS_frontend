New York (CNN Business) Gary Cohn, who quit a top job at Goldman Sachs to join the Trump administration in 2017, is the new vice chairman at tech giant IBM (IBM).

Cohn said in a tweet Tuesday that he was "honored to be joining IBM," which he described as "one the world's most important companies, providing technology that helps organizations be agile and resilient in unpredictable times."

Goldman Sachs GS Once viewed as a potential successor to Lloyd Blankfein as CEO of Wall Street giant, Cohn joined the White House shortly after Trump took over in 2017. But his tenure there as the director of the National Economic Council was rocky, and he left the administration in 2018 following a disagreement with Trump about the decision to impose more tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

Cohn also publicly rebuked Trump in 2017 after the President refused to criticize white supremacists after a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Cohn said at the time that Trump's response caused him "distress."

In an interview with CNN in 2019 , Cohn also said that he was "concerned" there was no one left in the White House to stand up to Trump and "tell him what he doesn't want to hear."
