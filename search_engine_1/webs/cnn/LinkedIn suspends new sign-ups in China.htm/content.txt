Hong Kong (CNN Business) LinkedIn — one of the few Western social media networks available in China — has suspended new sign-ups in the country, but said the decision has nothing to do with a recent cyberattack on parent company Microsoft.

Microsoft MSFT its Exchange email service and was able to gain access to computers. The company said the group was "assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China." revealed last week that a group called Hafnium exploitedits Exchange emailservice and was able to gain access to computers. The company saidthe group was "assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China."

A LinkedIn spokesperson said its decision was unrelated to the hack. The social media platform, which is used by professionals, was suspending new member sign-ups for LinkedIn China "as we work to ensure we remain in compliance with local law," it said in a statement.

Beijing has pushed back on the allegations that it is involved, warning last week that linking such attacks "directly to the government" is a "highly sensitive political issue" that shouldn't be based on "unprovoked guesses."
