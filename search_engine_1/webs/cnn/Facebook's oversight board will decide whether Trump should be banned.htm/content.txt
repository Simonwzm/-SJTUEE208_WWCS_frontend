(CNN Business) Donald Trump's future on Facebook and Instagram is now up in the air.

Facebook FB has referred its previous decision to suspend former President Donald Trump's posting privileges to its independent Oversight Board for review, the company said in a blog post Thursday.

Facebook said it wants the Oversight Board's binding ruling on the matter given its significance.

"We think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld," wrote Facebook VP of global affairs Nick Clegg. "While we await the board's decision, Mr. Trump's access will remain suspended indefinitely."

John Taylor, a Facebook Oversight Board spokesman, told CNN Business that, under its framework, the board will have 90 days to review the decision but "we expect to act more quickly than that."
