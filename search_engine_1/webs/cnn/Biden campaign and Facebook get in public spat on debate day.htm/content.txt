(CNN Business) With President Donald Trump's election campaign repeatedly sharing misinformation on social media, the Biden campaign wrote to Facebook on the eve of the first presidential debate calling on the company to take action against Trump.

Facebook's refusal to remove voter misinformation shared by the President amounted to the company becoming the "nation's foremost propagator of disinformation about the voting process," Jen O'Malley Dillion, Biden campaign manager, wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN.

Details of the letter were first reported by Axios

In recent weeks, Trump and his campaign have been posting false or baseless claims about the integrity of November's election and the voting process.

In most instances, rather than removing those false claims, Facebook has placed a label on them that links to authoritative information. A similar strategy is used by Twitter.
