New York (CNN Business) Tesla's Autopilot feature could soon face its second federal probe of the month.

The automaker's driver-assist and traffic-aware cruise control features are already under investigation by federal safety regulators for their role in a series of crashes. On Wednesday Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into the claims made by Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk about Autopilot and the company's full self-driving, or FSD, feature. They want the FTC to determine whether those claims amount to deceptive marketing practices.

"We fear that Tesla's Autopilot and FSD features are not as mature and reliable as the company pitches to the public," the two Democratic senators said in a letter to Lina Khan, chair of the FTC.

"Tesla and Mr. Musk's repeated overstatements of their vehicle's capabilities — despite clear and frequent warnings — demonstrate a deeply concerning disregard for the safety of those on the road and require real accountability," the letter continued. "Their claims put Tesla drivers — and all of the traveling public — at risk of serious injury or death."

The two senators have been frequent critics of Tesla's Autopilot. Just this past Monday, the duo cheeredz the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's investigation into a series of crashes involving Teslas hitting emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot feature.
