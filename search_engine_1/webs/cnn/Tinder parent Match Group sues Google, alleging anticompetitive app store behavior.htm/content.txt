Washington (CNN Business) The dating-app company behind Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com sued Google on Monday, alleging that the technology giant runs an illegal monopoly in the Google Play Store and that its in-app payment policies, including its 30% cut of some in-app purchases, are anticompetitive.

Match Group MTCH Google GOOG The suit byis the latest antitrust complaint to hitafter years of scrutiny over its business practices. The suit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Google not only has a monopoly on the distribution of Android apps, but also forces app makers to accept contract language that locks them into using Google's in-app payment technology and requires them to pay fees to Google.
