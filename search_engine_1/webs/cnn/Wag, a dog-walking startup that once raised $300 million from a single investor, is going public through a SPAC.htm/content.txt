(CNN Business) Wag, a dog-walking startup that once received $300 million from a single investor only to stumble in executing its strategy, is set to go public in a deal valued not much higher than that one investment.

Wag said Thursday that it has entered an agreement to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, known as a SPAC, at a valuation of $350 million. The combined company is expected to be named Wag! Group Co. and to list on the Nasdaq under the stock ticker "PET."

Wag, which launched in 2015, followed a similar playbook to Uber by connecting pet owners to a network of pet sitters and dog walkers who are treated as independent contractors. The company scaled to 100 cities, attracted celebrity endorsements and, eventually, caught the eye of SoftBank's Vision Fund, an investment fund known for cutting unusually large checks in startups to fuel their growth.

SoftBank poured $300 million into Wag in 2018, becoming its biggest backer , but things didn't go as planned. The company struggled to keep up with its rival, Rover. Nearly two years later, SoftBank gave up on its investment but not without a series of missteps by Wag first.

As CNN Business reported in September 2019 , Wag went through multiple rounds of layoffs, endured management changes, and failed to get its anticipated global expansion off the ground. Former employees told CNN Business that its then-CEO Hilary Schneider, a veteran tech executive who was tapped as CEO around the time of the SoftBank investment, had yet to get a handle on fundamental issues facing the business, including pet safety, customer service, and growth.
