Hong Kong (CNN Business) Tencent is dramatically cutting its stake in JD.com, China's second largest e-commerce company, as it seeks to stay on the right side of Beijing, which has been cracking down on tech giants to rein in their growing power and influence.

Tencent TCEHY JD.com JD plans to distribute more than $16 billion worth of its stake into its shareholders as a one-time dividend, the Chinese gaming and social media giant said Thursday in a stock exchange filing . The 457 million shares that Tencent plans to give out represent 86.4% of its stake at JD.com, or 14.7% of JD.com's total issued shares.

Currently, Tencent controls 17% of JD.com. After the distribution, its stake will drop to to 2.3%, which means it will no longer be JD.com's largest shareholder.

Walmart WMT JD.com founder Richard Liu Qiangdong, who holds 13.9% of shares, will become the biggest stakeholder, according to the company's latest annual report follows, with a 9.3% stake.

This surprising retreat by Tencent comes at a time when the country's internet giants are under intense pressure from Beijing.
