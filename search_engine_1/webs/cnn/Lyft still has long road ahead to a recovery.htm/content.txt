(CNN Business) Lyft is making some progress on the long road to recovery from what the coronavirus pandemic's done to its business.

The ride-hail company reported Tuesday that its revenue fell 44% compared to a year ago in the fourth quarter, to $570 million. Active riders fell 45% over the same period, to 12.5 million riders -- a slight increase compared to the third quarter.

Lyft LYFT 's fourth quarter earnings report gives a fuller picture of the ongoing negative impact of the pandemic on its business. The company said that, while the earlier part of the quarter benefited from some recovery, the latter part was "negatively affected by the surge in Covid-19 cases and the reintroduction of restrictive measures intended to curb the spread."

Lyft's business plummeted to 8.7 million riders in the second quarter before rebounding in the third quarter and maintaining that footing.

Lyft reported its net losses grew to $458 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $356 million a year earlier. Its losses for the full year of 2020 ($1.8 billion) narrowed compared to 2019 ($2.6 billion). Its revenue, on the other hand, decreased by 35% for the year, to $2.4 billion in 2020.
