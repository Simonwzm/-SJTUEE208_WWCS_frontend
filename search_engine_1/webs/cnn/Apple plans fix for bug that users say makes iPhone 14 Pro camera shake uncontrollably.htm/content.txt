(CNN Business) Apple said it is working on a software fix after some users who recently purchased an iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max reported their devices' rear-facing cameras shook "uncontrollably" and made strange noises when using social media apps.

"However, I don't run into any issues when I use the regular camera app." In videos and posts uploaded to social media sites, some users explained the issue only occurred when using the camera with third-party platforms, including Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. One YouTube user posted a video of the phone shaking while using TikTok. Other users on Reddit posted about similar issues. "I've been experiencing my camera shaking uncontrollably whenever I open Snapchat or use the camera for Instagram," one wrote."However, I don't run into any issues when I use the regular camera app."

Apple AAPL In a statement to CNN on Tuesday,said it is currently working on resolving the issue. "We're aware of the issue and a fix will be released next week," a company spokesperson said.

It's an early hiccup for Apple after unveiling a suite of new iPhones earlier this month. The Pro models, which feature the first 48 MP camera and a handful of new advanced features, are thought to be in particularly high demand this year, which could buoy Apple given these models start at $999.

At the same time, the iPhone 14 Pro models seem to have longer wait times than rest of the iPhone 14 lineup.
