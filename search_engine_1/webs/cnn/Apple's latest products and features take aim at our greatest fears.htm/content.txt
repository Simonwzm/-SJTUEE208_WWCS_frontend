(CNN) If you only tuned into the opening of Apple's iPhone event this week, you might have wondered whether you were watching an emergency first responder training session.

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the annual event on Wednesday with a three-minute video depicting how the Apple Watch has saved lives by calling for help. One man described how he was skating on a frozen river when the ice gave out. Another survived a plane crash in a remote area in the middle of winter. And a high school student escaped a bear encounter.

Another example from the event focused on a 27-year old high school teacher went to the emergency room after her Apple Watch detected an abnormally high heart rate. According to the teacher, "My doctor said, 'It was your watch that saved your life."

Apple has long presented its products as tools for creativity, productivity and a positive, if aspirational, lifestyle filled with friends and family, healthy habits and outdoor activities. Some of that was still on display at this year's event, but there was a new messaging, too. The company positioned many of its products and features as safety nets in a shaky world.

Apple announced new car-crash detection technology on both the Apple Watch and iPhone which it says can determine the "precise moment of impact" using the device's barometer, GPS and microphone. "We truly hope you never need it, but feel a little bit safer every time you get into a car," said Ron Huang, Apple's vice president of sensing and connectivity, during the announcement.
