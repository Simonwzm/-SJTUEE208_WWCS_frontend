New Delhi (CNN Business) The Chinese version of TikTok is introducing a "teenage mode" that will limit the amount of time children under the age of 14 spend on the short-form video app to 40 minutes a day.

The measure will apply to all Douyin users under the age of 14 who have registered for the app using their real names, Beijing-based ByteDance announced in a statement on Saturday.

Douyin will also be unavailable to those users between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., the owner of TikTok and Douyin added.

The company also urged parents to help their children register with real names, or otherwise manually enable "teenage mode." ByteDance did not immediately respond to a question from CNN Business about how it might enforce the policy for those who don't use their real names.

The app also said it would introduce new content — ranging from science experiments and museums to art gallery exhibition and natural scenery — to "inspire" younger teens.
