New York (CNN Business) The union that was the first to win a representation vote at an Amazon facility has filed for an election among about 400 employees at another Amazon distribution center.

The facility is in suburban Albany, New York. The National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union representation votes, has confirmed the filing but has yet to verify the signatures of the employees who signed cards asking for the vote. At least 30% of the employees in a potential bargaining unit need to sign cards for an election to be held.

"We're proud and happy for these workers to be standing up and fighting for their rights," said Chris Smalls, president of the Amazon Labor Union, which won the vote at an Amazon facility on Staten Island, New York, in April, but lost the vote at a second nearby facility in May.

Smalls said he is talking to employees who are working to hold elections at other facilities across the country, although he wouldn't say how many organizing campaigns are underway.

"There will be plenty more to come after that in short order. It's growing every week," he said. "All we can do is continue to build and organize. Hopefully the company will change their outlook once they see this is something not going away."
