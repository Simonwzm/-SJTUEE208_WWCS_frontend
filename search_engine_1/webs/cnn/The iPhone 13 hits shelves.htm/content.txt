(CNN Business) Apple (AAPL) officially launched its next-generation iPhone 13 line on Friday, with four new smartphones hitting shelves and shipping to customers who secured their orders early.

Last week, the company showed off its latest devices -- the iPhone 13 mini, the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, as well as a new iPad, iPad mini and Apple Watch -- at a closely-watched media event. Not long after iPhone pre-orders went live three days later, estimated arrival times for some models slipped to October or November. (The Apple Watch is not yet available for purchase.)

The new iPhones don't include any groundbreaking design changes or features, at least compared to last year's 5G announcement. But they do include better cameras, a longer-lasting battery and faster processing. Other additions include a massive storage option for the Pro models (1 terabyte), a new Portrait mode for shooting videos.

The updated iPad line, which is also available in stores, includes a faster processor, a new 12 MP ultrawide camera -- which uses machine learning to adjust the front-facing camera during FaceTime video calls -- and supports a True Tone feature that adjusts the screen's brightness to ambient lighting.

The stakes are high for Apple heading into Friday's launch. The iPhone, specifically, continues to be a major revenue driver for the company and remains central to its ecosystem of products. The releases also come amid some uncertainty: A US judge recently ruled that Apple can no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside the App Store. The company is facing antitrust scrutiny from regulators in the US and abroad, and Apple recently confronted weeks of controversy for its approach to combating child exploitation.
