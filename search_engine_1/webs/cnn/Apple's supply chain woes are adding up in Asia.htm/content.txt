Hong Kong (CNN Business) Apple has placed a second major supplier in Asia on probation after finding that the company delayed payments to workers â€” a breach that apparently spurred vandalism at a factory in India earlier this month.

The Silicon Valley tech firm launched an investigation after local Indian media reported that workers vandalized an iPhone factory near Bangalore run by Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron. A local labor minister and a labor organization told CNN Business last week that workers there claimed they were not being paid their wages.

Apple AAPL said in a statement to CNN Business that an independent audit conducted in the wake of the violence found that payment for some workers was delayed in October and November.

"Our main objective is to make sure all the workers are treated with dignity and respect, and fully compensated promptly," Apple said, adding that it has stopped placing new orders with Wistron as a result of its findings. "We are very disappointed and taking immediate steps to address these issues."

Wistron did not respond to multiple requests from CNN Business for comment on Monday. However, the company has let go of an executive in charge of its business in India, according to Taiwanese media reports.
