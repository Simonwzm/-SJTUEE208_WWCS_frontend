(CNN) Private astronaut missions to the International Space Station will have to be chaperoned by a former NASA astronaut, per new proposed requirements from the US space agency.

During the mission, dubbed AX-1, the four-member crew spent nearly two weeks off of Earth's surface, at least in part conducting experiments and other scientific work. Other space tourism companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic only offer customers short trips that allow for a few minutes of microgravity.

Among the most notable new policies for these pricey, private missions to the ISS is that "upcoming private astronaut missions include a former flown NASA (U.S.) government astronaut as the mission commander," according to the NASA update

The requirement is still being finalized, NASA added, but the agency noted that having a former, legitimate astronaut "provides experienced guidance for the private astronauts during pre-flight preparation through mission execution." The former NASA astronaut also "provides a link" between residents on the ISS and the private astronauts, which the agency said "reduces risk" to ISS operations and safety.
