(Reuters) Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday blocked a bid to ask voters whether app-based ride-share and delivery drivers should be treated as independent contractors rather than employees, in a setback for companies like Uber (UBER (UBER)) and Lyft (LYFT (LYFT)).

The unanimous decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court marked a victory for labor activists who sued and argued the ballot measure proposal contained loopholes that would create a sub-minimum wage for drivers for the companies.

The court said a ballot question that a coalition of app-based service providers hoped to put before voters in November went too far by including an unrelated proposal that would limit their liability for accidents by their drivers.

Justice Scott Kafker wrote that by including an unrelated proposal "buried in obscure language," the measure went beyond defining the relationship between app-based drivers and the companies.

He said that meant Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat running for governor, wrongly certified it complied with state constitutional requirements limiting ballot measures to related subjects.
