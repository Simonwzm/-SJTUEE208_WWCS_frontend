New York (CNN Business) Nearly 30,000 Macs worldwide have been infected with mysterious malware, according to researchers at security firm Red Canary.

The issue was somewhat confounding to Red Canary researchers, who said it's not clear what the malware's goal is. In a blog post, the firm said it did not observe the malware delivering "malicious payloads" â€” essentially, harmful actions against a device.

The malware, which the company calls Silver Sparrow, does not "exhibit the behaviors that we've come to expect from the usual adware that so often targets macOS systems," Tony Lambert, an intelligence analyst at Red Canary wrote.

Silver Sparrow includes a self-destruct mechanism that appears to have not been used, researchers said, adding that it's unclear what would trigger that function. They are also uncertain of how the malware got onto infected computers, though they believe it may have been through malicious search results.

The researchers found that Silver Sparrow contains code that runs natively on Apple's in-house M1 chip that was released in November, making only the second known malware to do so. However, this doesn't necessarily raise red flags about the chip.
