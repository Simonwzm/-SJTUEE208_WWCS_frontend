(CNN Business) Palantir Technologies, the secretive data company best known for taking on controversial work for the US government, made its Wall Street debut Wednesday.

The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "PLTR" just after 1:30pm ET at $10 a share, up from the reference price listed by the NYSE of $7.25 a share, which would have valued the company at nearly $16 billion, or below its $20 billion private market valuation. (Reference prices are guides for investors but do not dictate how the stock will open.)

Palantir's stock was 50% above its reference price about 30 minutes into trading. It finished the day at $9.50, or 31% above the reference price.

Following in the footsteps of Spotify and Slack, Palantir went public through a direct listing , meaning it did not rely on underwriters to assess demand and set a price. A direct listing only involves the sale of existing shares and no new capital is raised.

Asana, a task management software startup, also made its debut via a direct listing on Wednesday. The NYSE has listed it a reference price of $21 a share; Asana opened trading at around 12:35pm ET at $27. Its stock now up nearly 35% from its reference price.
