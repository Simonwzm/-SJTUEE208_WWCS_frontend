Washington, DC (CNN Business) Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, and which pioneered the self-driving car business, says it's done with the term "self-driving."

Waymo says that some automakers are using the phrase "self-driving" inaccurately, giving the public a false impression of what driver-assist systems are capable of. Waymo will instead refer to its vehicles as "fully autonomous," and hopes the shift will differentiate it from technologies meant to merely assist human drivers.

"This is more than just a branding or linguistic exercise," Waymo said in a blog post published Wednesday. "Precision in language matters and could save lives."

Waymo didn't call out a specific automaker in its blog post. But for months it has clashed with Tesla, which sells a $10,000 option on its vehicles, "full self-driving capability," that experts have long said oversells the technology's abilities and potentially creates safety issues. The vast majority of Tesla drivers cannot use the "full self-driving" feature, but Tesla says it includes all the necessary hardware for the technology. The company says that the software necessary for the feature will come at a later date for most Tesla drivers.

Most autonomous vehicle experts say that "full self-driving" means a car that a person could safely fall asleep in behind the wheel, no different from what Waymo calls a fully autonomous vehicle.
