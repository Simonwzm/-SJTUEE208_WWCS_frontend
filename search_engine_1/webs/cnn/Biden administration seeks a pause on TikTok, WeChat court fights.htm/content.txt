(CNN) The Biden administration has asked two federal appeals courts to pause litigation over former President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok and WeChat from the United States.

In a court filing Wednesday, the US government said the Biden administration seeks a pause while it conducts a review of the Trump administration's approach to the Chinese-linked social media company. TikTok declined to comment, but is not opposing the government's motion, according to the filing.

The administration filed a similar request on Thursday in a case over the future of WeChat, another app owned by a Chinese parent company, citing the same review. WeChat declined to comment.

Trump had sought to clamp down on TikTok over claims the app poses a national security risk, an assertion that TikTok has previously called unfounded. Last year, his administration tried to issue several restrictions aimed at the company, from forcing a sale to non-Chinese owners to prohibiting US app stores from carrying the app.

DC. Multiple courts issued preliminary injunctions blocking a number of the restrictions , including the app store ban and rules that would have made it illegal for internet backbone companies to carry TikTok's traffic. Trump's Justice Department filed an appeal that is now under consideration at a federal appeals court in Washington,DC.
