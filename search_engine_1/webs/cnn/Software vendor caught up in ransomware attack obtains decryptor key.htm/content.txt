(CNN Business) Kaseya, the software firm whose remote access tool was used to deliver REvil ransomware to hundreds of businesses around the world this month in a devastating supply-chain attack, has obtained a decryptor key allowing it to unlock networks seized by the malware, the company confirmed to CNN Business.

Kaseya is currently helping to restore the systems of customers whose networks were still locked down by REvil's software, it said.

"I can confirm we have received a decryptor and are currently working to assist the customers impacted by the attack," said Kaseya spokesperson Dana Liedholm. "We can't share the source but can say it's from a trusted third party."

Liedholm declined to answer further questions about whether the decryptor key had been reverse-engineered from the REvil malware.

Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, said his firm had verified the effectiveness of the key at restoring victim data.
