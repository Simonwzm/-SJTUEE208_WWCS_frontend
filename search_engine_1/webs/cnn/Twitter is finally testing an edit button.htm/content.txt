New York (CNN Business) After years of users clamoring for such a feature, Twitter is finally testing edited tweets.

Twitter TWTR said in — where else? — a tweet Thursday morning that some users may start seeing edited tweets in their feed because it is testing the long-awaited edit button.

"This is happening and you'll be okay," the company said.

In a Thursday blog post , the company said edited tweets are being tested internally and that the feature would expand to subscribers of its paid Twitter Blue service later this month. The test will first roll out to Twitter Blue subscribers in New Zealand, with Australia, Canada and the US to follow, according to the company. Users outside the test group will also be able to see edited tweets on the platform.

Twitter said in April that it had been testing an edit feature for a year, and that it would be available to Twitter Blue subscribers within months. The announcement came the same day the company announced that it would add Elon Musk to its board, and after he polled his followers about whether they'd like an edit button on the platform. When it confirmed the edit feature was in the works, Twitter also said, "no, we didn't get the idea from a poll."
