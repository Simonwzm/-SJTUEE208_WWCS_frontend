(CNN) iPhone owners with an Arizona driver's license or state ID can now upload either to their Apple Wallet, marking the first time a US state has supported digital versions of this type of identification in the app. But the uses remain very limited, for now.

Starting Wednesday, Arizona residents with TSA PreCheck can present their digital driver's license or state ID by tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at select Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. However, they'll still need their physical IDs to fly home if traveling to a state that's not in the Apple program â€” in other words, any other state in the country.

iPhone users will also still need to show their physical ID to, for example, enter a bar, get documents notarized or show law enforcement at traffic stops, both in other states and in Arizona. Apple said it is exploring more ways for people to use digital verification in the future.

Apple AAPL Last year, teased it was working with several states on the initiative, including Georgia, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah. Apple originally noted on its website that the feature would launch last year, but the company told CNN Business it was a complicated process to implement and it's been working closely with the states to make this available as soon as possible.

On Wednesday, Apple announced plans to also introduce the feature to Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio and Puerto Rico.
