New Delhi (CNN Business) India has seized more than $700 million from one of China's biggest tech companies after accusing it of moving money out of the country illegally.

In a statement on Friday , India's Enforcement Directorate — the country's main financial investigation agency — accused the Indian subsidiary of smartphone maker Xiaomi of violating foreign exchange laws by making "illegal remittances."

The agency said Xiaomi India, acting on the instructions of its parent company, "had remitted foreign currency equivalent to [55.5 billion rupees, $726 million] to three foreign based entities which include one Xiaomi group entity in the guise of royalty."

Xiaomi started its operations in India in 2014 and started remitting money a year later, the agency added. The Indian authorities have now seized an equivalent amount of funds "lying in the bank accounts of the company."

"Xiaomi India procures the completely manufactured mobile sets and other products from the manufacturers in India," the Enforcement Directorate said. "Xiaomi India has not availed any service from the three foreign based entities to whom such amounts have been transferred," the agency added.
