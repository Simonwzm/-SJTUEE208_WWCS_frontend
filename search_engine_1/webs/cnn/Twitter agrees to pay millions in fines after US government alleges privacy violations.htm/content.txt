(CNN Business) Twitter has agreed to pay $150 million in fines after the US government sued the social media company on Wednesday, alleging that it misled consumers about how it protects their personal data.

According to the federal lawsuit , Twitter failed to tell its users for years that it used their contact information to help marketers target their advertising â€” in violation of a 2011 privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.

"This practice affected more than 140 million Twitter users, while boosting Twitter's primary source of revenue," FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.

Twitter said Wednesday that the use of the personal information for ads was "inadvertent," and that the incident was first disclosed in 2019.

"This issue was addressed as of September 17, 2019, and today we want to reiterate the work we'll continue to do to protect the privacy and security of the people who use Twitter," Damien Kieran, Twitter's chief privacy officer, wrote in a blog post . "Keeping data secure and respecting privacy is something we take extremely seriously, and we have cooperated with the FTC every step of the way. In reaching this settlement, we have paid a $150M USD penalty, and we have aligned with the agency on operational updates and program enhancements to ensure that people's personal data remains secure and their privacy protected."
