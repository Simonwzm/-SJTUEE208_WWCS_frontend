The letter, signed by Allison Hendrix from the company's privacy and data policy team, also demanded the researchers delete all data they have gathered through the tool.

Laura Edelson, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at NYU and the lead researcher behind the project, said in a statement Friday evening that her team had built a tool that provides an analysis of political advertisers' and Facebook's practices "that is otherwise unavailable to the public, and which makes clear who is trying to influence us and why."
