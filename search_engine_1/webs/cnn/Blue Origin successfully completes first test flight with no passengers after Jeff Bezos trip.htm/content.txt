New York (CNN Business) The rocket that flew Jeff Bezos to space last month just took another brief, suborbital jaunt to the upper reaches of the atmosphere, this time without people on board, as the company continues to test the vehicle and prepare to offer rides to other ultra-wealthy thrill seekers.

It marked the 17th test flight for New Shepard, the suborbital rocket developed by Bezos' Blue Origin. The 60-foot-tall vehicle took off from a small launch pad at Blue Origin-owned facilities in West Texas Thursday morning, carrying only a few science experiments and pieces of art rather than passengers, and soared more than 60 miles over the landscape before coming to a pinpoint, upright landing at a nearby concrete pad.

The initial launch had been delayed by an hour due to what Blue Origin said was "a payload readiness issue," however the rest of the flight did not initially appear to be significantly impacted by the wait.

New Shepard's uncrewed, suborbital test missions have also frequently included experiments, and on Thursday's flight it flew a "lunar landing technology demonstration" on behalf of NASA. Basically, Blue Origin put a set of sensors and computer algorithms on the New Shepard rocket, testing technology could one day be used for navigating a lunar lander.

New Shepard attracted global attention last month when Bezos — along with three other passengers — became the first humans to ride aboard the rocket, which had until then only conducted uncrewed test flights.
