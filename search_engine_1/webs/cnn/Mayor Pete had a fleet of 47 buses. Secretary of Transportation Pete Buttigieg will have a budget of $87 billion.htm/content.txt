Washington, DC (CNN) South Bend, Indiana has a transit budget of about $10 million, covering 47 buses and fewer than 100 full-time employees.

Now the transportation budget of its former mayor, 38-year-old Pete Buttigieg, appears set to take a massive leap -- he'll soon manage over $85 billion after President-elect Joe Biden appointed him this week to lead the US Department of Transportation.

Those who are familiar with Buttigieg's work in South Bend say he's well-suited for the job given his track record, intellect, and view of transportation as about more than moving vehicles. They point to his success in revitalizing South Bend's downtown. He redesigned streets, which attracted new businesses, boosted property values and made the city safer for pedestrians.

But now Buttigieg is stepping onto a national stage, with bigger and more complicated challenges than what he faced in a city of about 100,000. He will have to address the challenges facing the nation's transit and ridehail workers as well as integrate electric and autonomous vehicles.

C. Michael Walton, a transportation professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that Buttigieg may not have as much direct experience as previous secretaries, but the most qualified candidates haven't always proven to be the most successful.
