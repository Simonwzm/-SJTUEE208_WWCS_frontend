New York (CNN Business) Three NASA astronauts and a European astronaut splashed down aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule off the coast of Florida after midnight Friday morning, capping off their six-month mission during which they worked alongside Russian cosmonauts and hosted the first all-private crew to visit the orbiting outpost.

The crew of this mission, called Crew-3 , departed the ISS in the early hours of Thursday morning and spent more than 20 hours free flying through orbit aboard the 13-foot-wide capsule before it plunged back into the atmosphere and parachuted to its water landing.

The four astronauts on the Crew-3 mission are NASA's Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, as well a German astronaut with the ESA, Matthias Maurer.

After the capsule made a safe landing, bobbing up and down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Chari told mission control: "Thanks for letting us take [Crew Dragon] Endurance on a shakedown cruise."

"Looking forward to watching many more flights of Endurance in the future," he said, using the "Endurance" name bestowed on Crew-3's capsule. "That was a great ride. Enjoyed working with the NASA and SpaceX team. Thanks for getting us to the space station and back safely."
