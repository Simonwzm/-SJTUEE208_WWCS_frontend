New York (CNN Business) Dozens of women sued Pornhub and its parent company Thursday, alleging that the site knowingly profited from videos depicting rape, child sexual exploitation, trafficking and other nonconsensual sexual content.

The civil complaint alleges that Pornhub parent company MindGeek, one of the largest online pornography companies, is a "classic criminal enterprise" with a business structure created to monetize nonconsensual sexual content â€” allegations Pornhub denies.

The suit was filed by Brown Rudnick LLP on behalf of 34 alleged victims of sexual exploitation, including minors, rape and human trafficking, and is seeking damages and protection for plaintiffs.

MindGeek owns over 100 pornographic websites , production companies and brands including Pornhub, RedTube, Tube8 and YouPorn. Among its various platforms, the company amasses 3.5 billion views per month, the lawyers said in a press release.
