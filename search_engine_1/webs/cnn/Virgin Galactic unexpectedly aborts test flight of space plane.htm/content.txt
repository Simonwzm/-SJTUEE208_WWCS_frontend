Austin, Texas (CNN Business) Virgin Galactic's supersonic rocket plane was scheduled to fire into the upper atmosphere Saturday, but after climbing more than 40,000 feet over New Mexico attached to its mothership, the space plane made an unexpected turn toward home rather than shooting skyward.

The company confirmed that the space plane, which was carrying test pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay, safely landed.

"The ignition sequence for the rocket motor did not complete," the company said via Twitter . "Vehicle and crew are in great shape. We have several motors ready at Spaceport America. We will check the vehicle and be back to flight soon."

A follow-up statement from Virgin Galactic's recently installed CEO, Michael Colglazier, a former Disney executive, said that VSS Unity's "onboard computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection." That triggered a "fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor," Colglazier said.

He added that Virgin Galactic will review the data collected during the flight and will set a re-do target date for the test flight in the "near future."
