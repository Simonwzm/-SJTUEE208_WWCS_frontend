Can You Chip In?



Please don't scroll past this—the Wayback Machine is a crucial resource in the fight against disinformation, and we need your help. The Internet Archive (which runs this project) relies on donations averaging just $25.51 to help us keep the record straight. We'd be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially.



Right now, we have a 2-to-1 Matching Gift Campaign, tripling the impact of every donation. We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute, we promise it will be put to good use. Access to information is more crucial than ever—if you find all these bits and bytes useful, please pitch in.
