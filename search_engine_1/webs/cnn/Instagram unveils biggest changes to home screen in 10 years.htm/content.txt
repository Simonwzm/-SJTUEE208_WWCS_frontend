(CNN Business) Navigating Instagram is about to look a little different.

Facebook FB On Thursday, the-owned company unveiled the first major change to its app's home screen in 10 years. The new design gives its 15-second video feature Reels its own tab, and also adds a button dedicated to shopping . The roll out starts Thursday.

With the changes, Instagram is making a big bet on the future of short-form video and online shopping, two categories it's been investing in heavily , but hasn't shared any metrics about, like how many people are actually using them. (Instagram declined to provide any stats to CNN Business on both Reels and shopping.)

The Reels tab is located where a "+" icon that people used to create a new post or Story used to be. That icon moves up to the top of the home page, along with the "heart" button where you check your activity, such as likes and follows. The "heart" button's previous spot is replaced with the new "Shop" tab, and the direct messaging icon stays put.

Instagram revamped its home screen (right), moving some tabs around, while adding new buttons for Reels and shopping.
