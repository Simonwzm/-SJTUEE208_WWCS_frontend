(CNN) Instacart is once again tweaking its tipping policy in a bid to address the effects on its workers of a practice known as "tip baiting," where customers zero out a tip after an order is delivered.

The company said Tuesday that it will cover the cost of a shopper's tip, up to $10, should a customer remove the tip after delivery without reporting an issue with their order.

The update is just the latest incremental measure Instacart has announced in recent years to address so-called tip baiting, while maintaining that it is an "exceedingly rare" event for its shoppers. Two years ago, CNN Business reported that some Instacart customers were bait-and-switching workers by offering up a large tip -- sometimes $50 or more -- and then taking it away after the delivery was dropped off.

As demand for Instacart skyrocketed in the early months of the pandemic, customers struggled to get time slots. Some resorted to tip baiting to entice Instacart shoppers, who are treated as independent contractors, to pick up their orders first but then removed the tip after delivery, leaving shoppers demoralized.

An Instacart spokesperson told CNN Business at the time that the vast majority of people were adjusting their tip upward or did not adjust their tip after delivery. Instacart also claimed that customers typically leave feedback if and when a tip is removed.
