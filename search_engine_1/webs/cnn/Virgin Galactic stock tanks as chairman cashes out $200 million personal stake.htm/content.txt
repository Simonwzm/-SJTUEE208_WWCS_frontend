Austin, Texas (CNN Business) Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE), the suborbital space tourism venture founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, plummeted Friday after the company's chairman dumped his personal stake in the company.

In a statement, Chamath Palihapitiya said he sold off a personal investment worth about $200 million for "a large investment I am making towards fighting climate change." He added that the details "will be made public in the next few months."

"I continue to be a significant investor in Virgin Galactic through Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings and I remain as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic's team, mission and prospects,"

Social Capital Hedosophia is the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that took Virgin Galactic public last year. Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive, took on the chairman role at Virgin Galactic after the merger.

News that Palihapitiya divested his personal stake sent Virgin Galactic shares tumbling as much as 14% Friday. That piled on to a multi-day selloff — fueled by investors steering away from tech stocks — that caused Virgin Galactic to shed nearly a third of its stock value. Shares were trading around $26 per share on Friday, far off the record high of more than $60 per share that it hit in early February.
