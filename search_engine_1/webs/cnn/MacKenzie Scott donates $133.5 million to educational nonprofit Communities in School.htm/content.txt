New York (CNN Business) MacKenzie Scott has donated $133.5 million to educational nonprofit Communities in School, an organization that helps students navigate issues inside and outside of the classroom.

The billionaire philanthropist's donation is the largest unsolicited gift in the program's history.

Communities in School works in 2,900 schools in America, supporting students at risk of dropping out and providing resources to help young people be successful, according to its website. The program helps 1.6 million kids in 26 states, and Scott's donation will allow the charity to keep "expanding to touch more lives and impact more students," CEO and program alumni Rey Salda√±a told "CBS Mornings."

The organization places staff inside schools to establish one-on-one connections with students to help them overcome challenges, and meets with schools and local service providers to give students the critical resources they need, according to its website. It has been supporting those under academic stress throughout the pandemic, it said.
