New York (CNN Business) Russia's Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case against Facebook parent company Meta Platforms accusing the company's employees of "illegal calls for murder and violence" against Russian citizens, according to a statement the committee published Friday.

The case follows a temporary change to Meta's hate speech policy that allows some Facebook and Instagram users to express violent sentiments against Russian armed forced invading Ukraine. Reuters first reported the policy change Thursday.

"A criminal case has been initiated in the Main Investigation Department of the Russian Investigative Committee in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta, which owns the social networks Facebook and Instagram," the Investigative Committee's statement said, citing the policy change.

"These actions contain signs of crimes under Articles 280 and 205.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation - public calls for extremist activities; assistance to terrorist activities," the statement reads.

Meta FB did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business regarding Russia's criminal investigation. However, in a statement Thursday, the company noted that the policy change does not allow calls for violence against Russians outside of the context of the Ukraine invasion.
