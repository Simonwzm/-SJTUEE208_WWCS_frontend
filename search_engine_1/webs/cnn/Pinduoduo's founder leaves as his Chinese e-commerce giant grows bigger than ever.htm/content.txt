Hong Kong (CNN Business) Pinduoduo's founder stepped down suddenly this week, shaking investors who had watched him take the Chinese e-commerce company from nothing to a potential Alibaba competitor in less than a decade.

Colin Huang's decision to resign as chairman wasn't a complete surprise. The 41-year-old entrepreneur already quit as CEO last summer, and was expected to eventually leave leadership at Pinduoduo altogether.

But his exit still came faster than expected, and during an uncertain time for many of China's internet firms as Beijing works to rein in the sector.

"The abrupt resignation of Mr. Huang was a big negative surprise to investors," wrote Nomura analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen in a Thursday research note. "Mr. Huang was widely regarded as the signature person of the company whose strong insight and leadership have been deemed by many investors as a key factor to the success" of Pinduoduo.

Pinduoduo PDD Shares inplummeted 7% in New York on Wednesday following Huang's announcement.
