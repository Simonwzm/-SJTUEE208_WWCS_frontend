Washington (CNN Business) AT&T and Verizon announced Tuesday that they would delay activating 5G on some towers around certain airports. The wireless technology's rollout near major airports had been scheduled for Wednesday, but airlines warned of dire consequences for transportation and the economy.

AT&T made the announcement as it works with the aviation industry and the US Federal Aviation Administration for further information, according to a statement from AT&T spokesperson Megan Ketterer.

"We are frustrated by the FAA's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner," the spokeswoman said.

"As the nation's leading wireless provider, we have voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports," Verizon said in a separate statement. "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation's airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries."

AT&T T , which owns CNN's parent company, and Verizon will continue to launch advanced 5G services everywhere else as planned.
