London (CNN Business) Twitter has updated its privacy policy so that it can remove images of people that have been posted without their consent, the company said in a blog post Tuesday.

Under its current policy, the social media giant prohibits the publication of people's private information , including addresses, phone numbers, identity documents and medical records.

Now, it says it has added "private media" to the list, because the sharing of such material could be used to "harass, intimidate, and reveal the identities of individuals."

"Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person's privacy, and may lead to emotional or physical harm," the company said.

"The misuse of private media can affect everyone, but can have a disproportionate effect on women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities," it added.
