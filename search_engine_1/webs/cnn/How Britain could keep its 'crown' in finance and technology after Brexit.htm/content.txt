London (CNN Business) The United Kingdom should introduce special visas and overhaul its stock market rules to allow entrepreneurs to keep control of their companies if it wants to remain competitive in financial technology after Brexit.

Those are among the recommendations contained in a new report published on Friday. It is one of several reviews commissioned by the UK government to strengthen the hugely important financial services sector that is facing a precarious future because of the country's exit from the European Union.

"Britain has a proud record of starting up and scaling up some of the best known fintech products, but we cannot rest on our laurels," said Ron Kalifa, the former CEO of payment processing company WorldPay, who led the review. "The next powerhouses will not be created by accident," he added.

The United Kingdom has more than 10% of the global fintech market and the sector is now worth more than £11 billion ($15.3 billion) a year to the UK economy, according to the report.

But Britain's departure from the European Union — completed on Dec. 31 — has made it much harder for UK-based companies to access the vast EU markets. That could make the country less attractive to fast-growing digital banks and payments companies. In addition, new tougher UK immigration rules have made it more costly and cumbersome to hire Europeans.
