London (CNN Business) Uber is facing legal action over its use of facial recognition software that allegedly discriminates against people of color.

The legal claims were launched this week with help from two unions, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU). Union officials and Uber drivers staged a protest outside the company's offices in London on Wednesday.
