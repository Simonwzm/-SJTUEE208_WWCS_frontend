New York (CNN) A former Zoom employee is wanted by the FBI for his alleged participation in a scheme to censor meetings on behalf of the Chinese government.

Xinjiang "Julien" Jin and co-conspirators allegedly terminated at least four video meetings commemorating the thirty-first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June. Most of of the meetings were organized and attended by US participants, some of whom were dissidents who had participated in and survived the 1989 protests, court documents show.

Zoom is not named in the complaint but sources familiar with the investigation identified the company as Zoom. The company confirmed that Jin was a former employee based in China.

"We learned during the course of our investigation that the China-based former employee charged today violated Zoom's policies by, among other things, attempting to circumvent certain internal access controls," Zoom said in a statement. "We also learned that this former employee took actions resulting in the termination of several meetings and accounts, and shared or directed the sharing of a limited amount of individual user data with Chinese authorities."

Zoom said it "terminated" the employee for violating company policies and has "placed other employees on administrative leave pending the completion of our investigation."
