Instagram said Wednesday that users will be able to select from two new ways to display posts in their feed in reverse chronological order.

Users can add up to 50 favorites, and posts from these accounts will show up higher in their home feeds, as indicated by a star icon. People are not notified when they are added or removed from those lists.
