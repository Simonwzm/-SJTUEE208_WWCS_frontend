(CNN) Uber's future used to be self-driving cars. Now it's delivering alcohol.

On Tuesday, the company announced that it is acquiring alcohol delivery startup Drizly for $1.1 billion in stock and cash. The deal, which is not yet complete, will result in Drizly being integrated into Uber's food delivery app while also remaining a standalone app.

The news comes as delivery services have seen skyrocketing demand during the pandemic. Uber has leaned on Eats, its food delivery business, while its core rides business has plummeted.
