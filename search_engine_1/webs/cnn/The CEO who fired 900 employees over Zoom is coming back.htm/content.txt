New York (CNN Business) The CEO of Better.com, best known for firing 900 employees over Zoom just before Christmas, is coming back to work.

Vishal Garg is returning to his "full-time duties" as CEO, according to a letter sent to employees Tuesday from the company's board of directors. The letter noted that Garg used a leave of absence to "reflect on his leadership, reconnect with the values that make Better great and work closely with an executive coach."

The online mortgage company's letter to employees, which was obtained by CNN Business, also said an outside law firm reviewed Better's workplace culture. The company is implementing changes, including adding more managers and a chief human resources officer.
