Hong Kong (CNN Business) China has ordered the country's biggest online payments platform to overhaul large swaths of its operations as regulators continue their efforts to rein in some of the most powerful Chinese internet companies.

Financial regulators outlined a laundry list of expectations for Ant Group executives in a meeting on Saturday, according to Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China. The central bank on Sunday released a transcript of remarks that Pan made to the media about the meeting with Ant Group. Representatives from the central bank attended the meeting, along with securities, banking and foreign exchange regulators.

The officials blasted Ant Group for having "defied" regulations, edging out rivals from the market place, harming consumer rights and taking advantage of regulatory loopholes for its own profit. They also accused the company's corporate governance structure of being "unsound," according to Pan's statement.

Alibaba BABA Authorities didn't explicitly call for a breakup of Ant Group, the-affiliated company that operates China's largest digital wallet, Alipay, and offers everything from investment accounts and micro savings products to insurance, credit scores and even dating profiles. The business is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma.

But Pan's statement did suggest that Beijing wants Ant Group to overhaul its operations. Regulators told the company — which has evolved from a digital payments platform to a sprawling financial empire — to "go back" and focus on its "original" payments services, among other tasks, according to Pan.
