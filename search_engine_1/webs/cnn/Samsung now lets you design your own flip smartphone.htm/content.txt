(CNN Business) Smartphone design hasn't varied much in years and customers are typically beholden to whatever decisions manufacturers make.

But during a virtual press event on Wednesday, Samsung aimed to change that with a concept that makes users part of the design process.

The company showed off a made-to-order version of its Flip 3 smartphone that allows people to pick from a handful of design options that may reflect their personality or taste. It's possible to choose frame options of black or silver, select various colors (blue, yellow, white, pink or black) for its front and back panels, or go for a stripes pattern. The company said up to 49 combinations are possible. It builds on its existing Bespoke line of products, such as refrigerators
