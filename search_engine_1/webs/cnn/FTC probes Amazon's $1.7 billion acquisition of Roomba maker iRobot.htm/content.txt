Washington (CNN Business) The Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at Amazon's proposed acquisition of iRobot, the company that produces the Roomba series of automated vacuum cleaners, according to a financial disclosure on Tuesday.

On Monday, the FTC requested more information from both companies about the $1.7 billion deal, according to an investor filing from iRobot, in what's known as a "second request" and an indicator of deeper scrutiny by antitrust officials.

The investigation highlights how FTC officials are closely reviewing Amazon's merger activity following calls by consumer advocates for the iRobot deal to be blocked.

Earlier this month, more than two dozen groups wrote to the agency alleging the deal could help Amazon "entrench their monopoly power in the digital economy." For starters, they argued, Amazon could seek to sell Roombas at a loss or in connection with its Prime subscription service and potentially drive other smart vacuum makers out of business. Furthermore, they claimed, Amazon's control of Roombas could give it access to detailed data about consumers' home layouts, interiors and lifestyle that could benefit its e-commerce business at the expense of rivals that do not have access to that trove of data.
