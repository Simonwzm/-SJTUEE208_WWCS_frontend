New York (CNN Business) An overwhelming majority of people around the globe want emojis to be more inclusive and culturally distinct so they can show how they feel, according to a new Adobe study.

Adobe's latest Global Emoji Diversity & Inclusion report released Thursday found 83% of global emoji users want designers of the small digital images used to convey emotions to incorporate more inclusive representation.

The survey of 7,000 frequent emoji users from seven countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, Australia and South Korea, revealed 54% of respondents felt their identity was adequately reflected in current emoji options. Just 37% of emoji users with a disability said they felt represented by currently available emoji.

"Culture was the No. 1 category of emoji that respondents wanted to see more inclusion in, followed closely by age and race / ethnicity," Adobe typeface designer & font developer Paul Hunt wrote in a blog post on the study. "This is especially the case for respondents that speak more than one language, and for 41% of Gen Z, who want to see culture better reflected in emoji options."

In the United States and the United Kingdom, 80% of Black emoji users, 78% of Latinx emoji users and 71% of Asian emoji users expressed a desire for more emoji options that reflect their personal identities. Seventy-two percent of LGBTQ+ global emoji users said they wish they had more options.
