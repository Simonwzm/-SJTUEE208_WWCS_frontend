(CNN Business) Social media companies are on high alert for a verdict in the trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd, knowing that their platforms have been used in the past to inflame tensions in the United States and that the same thing could well happen again in the wake of the verdict.

Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of Floyd last May. The jury has reached a verdict , which will be announced Tuesday afternoon.

On Monday, hours before the jury began its deliberations, Facebook's vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said the company had designated Minneapolis as "high-risk" and was working on "preventing online content from being linked to offline harm" after the verdict.

"Our teams are working around the clock to look for potential threats both on and off of Facebook and Instagram so we can protect peaceful protests and limit content that could lead to civil unrest or violence," Bickert said in a blog post . That includes "identifying and removing calls to bring arms to areas in Minneapolis" and removing "content that praises, celebrates or mocks George Floyd's death," she added.

Google, which owns video platform YouTube, also said it was on high alert for misinformation and hate speech.
