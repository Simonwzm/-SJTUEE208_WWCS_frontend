(CNN) Two women alleged that they were sexually assaulted when they were teenagers by Trevor Milton, the founder and former executive chairman of Nikola Motor Company.

The two women -- one who was identified as Milton's cousin, Aubrey Smith, and the other whose identity is being withheld and is referred to as a Jane Doe -- are being represented by Utah-based attorney Craig Johnson. The women allege they were sexually assaulted by Milton in 1999 and 2004 when both women were 15, respectively.

Smith's complaint was filed with the Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake in Utah on Saturday. Sergeant Melody Cutler with the Department confirmed to CNN Business that it received a complaint regarding a sexual assault incident in September 1999 against Milton, when he would have been 17, on Saturday.

"Mr. Milton strongly denies these false allegations," said Brandon Messina, a spokesperson for Trevor Milton, in a statement to CNN Business. "At no point in his life has Mr. Milton ever engaged in any inappropriate physical contact with anyone," Messina added.

Nikola referred requests for comment to Milton.
