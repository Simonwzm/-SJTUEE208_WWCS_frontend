(CNN Business) Google has reached a settlement with six engineers who alleged the company unlawfully retaliated against them over their workplace organizing efforts.

The settlement, first reported by Vice News Monday, was confirmed by labor attorney Laurie Burgess, who represented the workers, as well as in a court filing Friday.

The deal ends two workplace-related legal fights for the tech giant: a high-profile National Labor Relations Board case, which kicked off with a trial on August 2021, and a lawsuit filed in November by three of the workers over an alleged breach of contract. The workers claimed Google violated an element of its code of conduct, which includes "Don't be Evil" as a guidepost, when it fired them after organizing against its work with US Customs and Border Protection.

The company has previously denied retaliating against the workers, claiming that it terminated or disciplined employees over violating company policies. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom said in a statement: "We settled the NLRB charges and associated litigation, and are pleased for all sides to avoid years of legal proceedings. We've always supported our employees' right to speak about working conditions, and we stand by our policies that protect the security of our systems and safeguard user, customer and employee data."
