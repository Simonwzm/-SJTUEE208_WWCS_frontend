New York (CNN Business) The fire on board the large car-carrying cargo ship Felicity Ace could soon be extinguished because there might not be anything left to burn.

carried The 656 foot-long Felicity Ace roll-on/roll-off car-carrying ship caught fire in the North Atlantic last Wednesday as itcarried around 4,000 vehicles , including Porsches, Volkswagens, Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Audis from Emden, Germany to Davisville, Rhode Island. All 22 crew members on board safely abandoned ship after the fire began to spread.

A full five days after the cargo ship and the luxury cars it was carrying on board began to burn 90 nautical miles southwest of Portugal's Azores islands, captain João Mendes Cabeças told the Portuguese news agency Lusa that "the fire had subsided in recent hours," thanks to a lack of materials left to blaze through.

Two large tugboats arrived on the scene Tuesday from Gibraltar and are spraying the ship with water to cool it down, according to a statement from the owner of the Felicity Ace, Japanese ship operator Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL). The tugboats will also help to position the Felicity Ace as safety conditions are assessed. Once approved, the initial salvage team will board and provide more insight on the damage as well as next steps. Two salvage boats are en route to the cargo ship to assist with firefighting and towing, according to the statement.

Cabeças told Reuters over the weekend that the fire was being kept alive by the lithium-ion batteries of the electric cars on board, with flames edging closer and closer to the fuel tanks of the ship. A main concern of the Portuguese navy has been the potential environmental impact of the fire. Pollution is a high risk with the large amount of fuel and car batteries present.
