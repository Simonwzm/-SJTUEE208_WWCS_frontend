(CNN) After years of accusations that it's helped spread misinformation, Twitter is finally giving users an easy way to report misleading tweets. But don't expect anything to happen right away because of it.

Twitter TWTR users in some countries, including the United States, will now be able to report tweets to the social media platform that contain misinformation, the company announced on Tuesday.

The new feature became available Tuesday to small groups of users in the US, South Korea and Australia, Twitter said. The explanation "it's misleading" will now appear as an option for those users to select when they seek to report a problematic tweet.

But the limited test may not lead to any direct action on the tweets flagged by users, according to the company.

"We may not take action on and cannot respond to each report in the experiment, but your input will help us identify trends so that we can improve the speed and scale of our broader misinformation work," Twitter said.
