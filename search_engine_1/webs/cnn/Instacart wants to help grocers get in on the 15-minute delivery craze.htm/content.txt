(CNN) Instacart wants to help grocery stores get in on the ultra-fast delivery craze.

The on-demand grocery delivery company on Wednesday announced several new services for retail partners, including one called Carrot Warehouses, which promises to help grocers build out the infrastructure to support 15-minute deliveries. That would cut Instacart's quickest existing option — 30-minute deliveries — in half.

In an interview with CNN Business this week, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo said the details may differ depending on the retailer but "the standard model" for the new service will entail Instacart leasing small warehouse facilities and handling "a lot of the labor and technology." The retailers will supply the goods and be in charge of inventory and supply chain management.

"They would basically leverage all the things they're extremely good at," said Simo. "That being said, the thing that is interesting about our model ... is we adapt to whatever they want based on their needs."

Instacart said it has struck a partnership with supermarket chain Publix to offer 15-minute deliveries in Atlanta and Miami in the "coming months." Simo declined to talk specifics on how the Publix partnership will be set up.
