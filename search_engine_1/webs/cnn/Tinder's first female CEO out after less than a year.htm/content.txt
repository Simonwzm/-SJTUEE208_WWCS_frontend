(CNN Business) Tinder's newest CEO is out after less than a year on the job, marking the second high-profile female executive to depart its parent company, Match Group, in a matter of months.

Match Group's newly tapped CEO Bernard Kim announced Tinder CEO Renate Nyborg's departure on Tuesday in a letter to shareholders that outlined his "observations" from 62 days on the job.

"Our goal is to inspire our brands to optimize everything we do and build the best teams internally to deliver the finest services externally," wrote Kim, making clear that Tinder has fallen short on product execution, attracting new users, and getting people to spend money even as it has continued to add new bells and whistles to its app in recent quarters. Those additions include an integration with Spotify called "Music Mode," which allows people to share a music "Anthem" on their profile and "Blind Date," a feature that pairs people based on interests before revealing their photos.

The letter accompanied the dating app giant's earnings for the three months ending in June, which sent Match Group stock down 20% on Wednesday. Match Group, which owns companies including Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and Match.com, indicated that while most of its businesses benefited from the widespread availability of Covid vaccines in the second half of 2021 leading people to engage more offline, it hasn't seen the same sort of surge in 2022.

Match Group reported total revenue of $795 million, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year but below its forecast of between $800 million and $810 million. On a call to discuss its earnings Wednesday, Match Group's chief financial officer noted that Tinder's lower-than-expected revenue contribution had a "meaningful negative effect on our overall company margins."
