Hong Kong (CNN Business) As China sharpens its antitrust crackdown on the country's massive tech companies, two of the industry's biggest players are taking the fight to each other.

Tencent TCEHY Douyin — the Chinese version of short-form video app TikTok -— suedon Tuesday, claiming that the Shenzhen-based social media firm has abused its "market dominance" to edge out rivals.

Douyin, which like TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, filed a lawsuit alleging that Tencent's WeChat and QQ messaging apps ban their users from sharing content from Douyin for three years, the company said Tuesday in a statement it published on its official WeChat account

While CNN Business has not seen the suit filed with the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, several state media outlets, including the Beijing Daily, have reported that Douyin is asking Tencent to lift its content restrictions and pay 90 million yuan ($14 million) in economic losses and fees.

"We believe that competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation," a Douyin spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business. "We have filed this lawsuit to protect our rights and those of our users."
