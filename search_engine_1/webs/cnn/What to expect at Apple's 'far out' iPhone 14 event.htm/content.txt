(CNN Business) Apple is expected to debut its iPhone 14 lineup at the company's annual September keynote event on Wednesday.

The product event, which has been teased with a "far out" tagline, will take place at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and will be livestreamed on Apple's website and social media channels.

This year's invitation featured a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo, leading some to speculate there will be major camera upgrades on iPhones to allow for better nighttime or long-distance photography. But in typical Apple fashion, the tech giant was sparse on details as it builds up excitement and urges customers to tune in on the big day.

The event will kick off at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and CNN Business will carry live coverage of it. Here is a look at what to expect from CEO Tim Cook and his team.
