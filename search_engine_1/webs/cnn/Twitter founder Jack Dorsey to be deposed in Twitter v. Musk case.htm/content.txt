New York (CNN Business) Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey will be questioned on Tuesday morning by lawyers for the company and Elon Musk as part of the court fight over their $44 billion acquisition deal, according to a notice of a deposition filed Monday.

Dorsey — who stepped down as CEO of Twitter last November and remained on the board until late May — was previously subpoenaed by Musk's team for a wide range of information, including all documents and communications regarding the merger agreement as well as those "reflecting, referring to, or relating to the impact or effect of false or spam accounts on Twitter's business and operations."

Twitter TWTR Musk in July moved to terminate the deal over claims that the company has misrepresented the number of fake and spam accounts on its platform, andquickly sued Musk to follow through with the agreement.

Prior to Musk's move to end the deal, Dorsey had spoken positively about the prospect of a Musk takeover of Twitter. Shortly after the acquisition was announced, Dorsey tweeted : "Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness."

The deposition comes as Musk's team expands its case against Twitter. A judge earlier this month ruled Musk could add to his claims based on the whistleblower disclosure by former Twitter head of security Peiter Zatko, who accuses the company of serious security vulnerabilities that put its users, investors and US national security at risk.
