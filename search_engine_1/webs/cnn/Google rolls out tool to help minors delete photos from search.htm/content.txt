(CNN Business) Google is now making it easier for minors or their parents to have photos of them deleted from search results.

In a blog post published Wednesday, the company said it is rolling out a tool that lets parents and kids under the age of 18 request photos be removed from its images tab or no longer appear as thumbnails in a search inquiry.

Google GOOG Althoughpreviously offered ways for people to request the removal of personal information and photos that fit into categories such as "non-consensual explicit" or "financial, medical and national ID," it's now extending this to images of minors.

"We know that kids and teens have to navigate some unique challenges online, especially when a picture of them is unexpectedly available on the internet," the company said in the blog post. "We believe this change will help give young people more control over their digital footprint and where their images can be found on Search."

The new form allows users to flag URLs of any images or search results that contain pictures they want removed. Google said its teams will review each submission and reach out if they need additional information to verify the requirements for removal.
