New York (CNN) Twenty years ago this weekend, Apple launched the original, iconic iPod. Six years later, I was gifted my first and only version of the device: a third-generation iPod Nano, fit with a square screen, a click wheel and an engraving on the back: "Sofia Barrett, Happy 11th Birthday."

(Though, as a teenager with no job, I still asked my parents for their credit cards to buy songs like "Fergalicious" and "Hot N Cold" for $1.29 a piece.)

My music taste and enjoyment was all at once simplified into data points.
