New York (CNN Business) A judge has ordered Google to turn over hundreds of internal documents — many related to its efforts to quash an employee union — as part of a National Labor Relations Board case over the tech giant's firing of former employees.

Google GOOGL GOOGLE In 2019, a group of workers who had recently been fired fromfiled unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB , claiming they had been fired for speaking out about the company's practices, such as signing controversial government contracts, and for engaging in protected labor organizing. Google has maintained that the employees were let go for repeated violations of its policies. But in 2020, the NLRB filed a complaint alleging Google had violated labor laws with two of the firings, claiming it had unlawfully targeted and surveilled employees engaged in organizing activities.

This latest ruling by administrative judge Paul Bogas, issued on Friday, marks a blow to Google in defending against the labor claims. It also comes as a larger battle heats up between big tech companies and their employees. Employees at Google and its parent, Alphabet, announced the launch of the Alphabet Workers Union , a minority union affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, last January, marking an historic step for the tech industry.

In his ruling, Bogas said Google had wrongfully claimed that the documents, which were subpoenaed as part of the former employees' case, were subject to attorney-client privilege or work product privilege, calling the company's arguments "not persuasive" and "an overreach."

In a statement to CNN Business, Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom said the company disagrees with the characterization of the documents.
