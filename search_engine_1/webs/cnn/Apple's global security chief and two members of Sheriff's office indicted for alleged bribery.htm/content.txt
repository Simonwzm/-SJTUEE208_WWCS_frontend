(CNN Business) Apple's global head of security and two members of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office have been indicted by a grand jury for allegedly requesting and offering bribes for concealed weapons licenses.

Santa Clara County Undersheriff Rick Sung and Captain James Jensen "managed to extract" a promise from Thomas Moyer, Apple's chief security officer, that the company would donate iPads to the sheriff's office in exchange for four firearms licenses that were withheld from Apple employees, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office said in a statement Monday. The District Attorney's Office conducted a two-year investigation in which it found that Sung and Jensen "held up" the licenses, refusing to release them until they got something of value, the statement added.

"Undersheriff Sung and Captain Jensen treated CCW licenses as commodities and found willing buyers. Bribe seekers should be reported to the District Attorney's Office, not rewarded with compliance," District Attorney Jeff Rosen said.

Moyer allegedly offered to donate hundreds of Apple products to the sheriff's office in exchange for the concealed gun licenses.

"The promised donation of 200 iPads worth close to $70,000 was scuttled at the eleventh hour just after August 2, 2019, when Sung and Moyer learned of the search warrant that the District Attorney's Office executed at the Sheriff's Office seizing all its CCW license records," the district attorney's office said in a statement.
