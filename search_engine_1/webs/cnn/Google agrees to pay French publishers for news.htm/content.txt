London (CNN Business) Google will pay news publications in France for the use of their content online in a landmark agreement that could soon be replicated elsewhere in Europe under new copyright laws.

Google GOOGL The tech company and APIG, which represents French news media, said in a joint statement on Thursday that they have agreed on principles for how news publications should be compensated for the distribution of their content onplatforms after months of talks.

Google has long tussled with publishers over how it displays their content, with media companies arguing the search giant should pay them for the privilege.

When new rules went into effect last year in France requiring publishers to be paid for snippets of news stories displayed in search results, Google announced it would only display headlines. In April, the French competition authority ruled that Google had abused its market dominance and ordered the company to negotiate with French publishers.

The statement did not provide details on how much publishers would be paid.
