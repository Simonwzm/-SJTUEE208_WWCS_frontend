(CNN Business) Whitney Wolfe Herd isn't based in Silicon Valley. She doesn't have a STEM degree and she didn't raise billions in venture capital. But Wolfe Herd's company, Bumble, is set to have one of the most high-profile technology IPOs of the year so far, in what will be a milestone moment not just for her business but for female founders generally.

Bumble, best known for its female-centered dating app, began trading on the Nasdaq Thursday under the stock ticker "BMBL."

Bumble priced its stock at $43 Wednesday evening, up from its original proposed price range of between $28 and $30, signaling strong investor demand in what's proven to be a lofty market for newly public tech companies. Shares surged immediately upon trading, opening at $76, a 77% increase.

The company was founded in 2014 by Wolfe Herd, who started her career at another dating service, Tinder. She initially set out to create a women-focused social network before landing on the concept of a female-focused dating app. Bumble requires women searching for heterosexual matches to make the first move, the idea being that this feature would empower women to make their own choices.

The idea took off. Bumble, headquartered in Austin, has become a household name even as it competes in a crowded market for dating apps. It also now offers services beyond dating, including professional networking (Bumble Bizz) and finding new friends (Bumble BFF).
