New York (CNN) Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, says it has evidence the Belarusian KGB used fake accounts to pose as journalists and activists to stoke tensions about the crisis at the border between Belarus and Poland.

"These fictitious personas posted criticism of Poland in English, Polish, and Kurdish, including pictures and videos about Polish border guards allegedly violating migrants' rights," Meta said in an announcement Wednesday.

To make the fake personas convincing, some of the accounts likely used profile pictures of fake faces generated using artificial intelligence , so-called "deepfake" technology, Meta said.

CNN is reaching out to the Belarusian KGB for comment.
