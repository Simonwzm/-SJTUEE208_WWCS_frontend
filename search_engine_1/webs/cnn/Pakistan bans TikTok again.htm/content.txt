Islamabad (CNN Business) TikTok has been banned in Pakistan for a second time.

The popular short-form video app is no longer available on mobile devices in the country after regulators issued an order late Thursday to "immediately" block access to it.

Pakistan's Telecommunications Authority said it banned TikTok after a provincial court in Peshawar called for the platform to be removed.

According to a court order, judges argued that the app was "detrimental to the youth" of Pakistan. They also claimed that "videos being uploaded [were] against the set norms and values" of the country.

The platform was first blocked last October , after the telecommunication authority accused it of of hosting "immoral" and "indecent" content.
