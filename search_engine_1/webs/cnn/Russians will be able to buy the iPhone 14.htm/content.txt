Russians will have the chance to buy the new Apple iPhone 14, despite the US tech company having left the country, thanks to Moscow's parallel import scheme, a senior government official told the RIA Novosti news agency on Thursday.

Russia announced the scheme in March when it authorized retailers to import products from abroad without the trademark owner's permission.
