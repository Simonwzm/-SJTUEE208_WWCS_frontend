New York (CNN Business) Boeing launched its Starliner spacecraft, designed to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, on an uncrewed test mission toward the orbiting outpost Thursday evening. After two prior attempts to complete such a mission failed, Boeing's goal is to prove the spacecraft can dock with the ISS. It must succeed before it can move on to missions with people on board.

The spacecraft took to the skies at 6:54 pm ET Thursday, riding atop an Atlas V rocket that launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. After the rocket delivered the capsule into orbit, the spacecraft fired up its own thrusters to orient it in the right direction. Boeing officials confirmed the Starliner's "orbital insertion" — a sign the spacecraft is on the right path — about half an hour after liftoff.

But during a post-launch briefing, officials revealed that the thrusters didn't work exactly as intended.

"We had two to thrusters fail," Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said. "The first one that fired, it fired for a second and then it shut down. The flight control system did was what it's supposed to, and it turned it over to the second thruster."

That thruster then fired for only about 25 seconds before shutting down, according to Nappi. The flight control system again took over and kicked on a third thruster, which fired as intended.
