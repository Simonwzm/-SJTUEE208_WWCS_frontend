New York (CNN Business) Staying home and gaming is definitely a trend during the pandemic, but it has been hard for people to get their hands on the latest consoles.

AMD AMD Microsoft Executive Vice President of Gaming Phil Spencer acknowledged the Xbox shortage in a podcast interview last week with Xbox Live programming director Larry Hryb, and said he has sought help from chipmakerin making more units available. AMD makes the processor and graphics chips for the Xbox consoles.

"I was on the phone last week with (CEO) Lisa Su at AMD (asking), 'How do we get more? How do we get more?,' So it's something that we're constantly working on," Spencer said. He did not go into detail about how AMD might help make more units available more quickly, and AMD did not immediately respond to CNN Business' request for comment.

"We got the consoles launched â€” wish we had more of them, we're selling out too quickly," Spencer added.
