(CNN) OnlyFans said Wednesday that it will suspend its upcoming policy change to restrict sexually explicit material, citing "assurances" it received that would allow it to be "a home for all creators."

"We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change," the company said in a tweet . "OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators."

Asked by CNN Business whether the announcement means the policy change might take effect at a later date, and whether the company agreed to make any changes to appease banks and allow for this reversal, OnlyFans said: "The proposed October 1, 2021 changes are no longer required due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators."

The reversal comes just days after OnlyFans announced it would bar creators from posting "content that contains sexually explicit conduct," sparking an outcry among sex workers who had helped create the company's success and popularity. OnlyFans said the changes followed requests by "banking partners and payout providers."

In an interview with the Financial Times that published earlier this week, OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokley blamed banks such as Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan, whom he said had blocked OnlyFans' payments to creators and shut down their accounts. (Those companies declined to comment to CNN Business on Tuesday.)
