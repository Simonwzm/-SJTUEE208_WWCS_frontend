(CNN Business) Thousands of Amazon's tech workers have signed a petition calling for the e-commerce giant to provide paid time off to all of its employees to vote.

More than 3,000 employees have signed the petition , which launched Tuesday morning via an internal company tool and was organized by Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group of corporate employees that originally formed to advocate on climate issues, applying pressure to the company and seeing some results.
