(CNN Business) Amazon is fighting the US government's attempt to question its founder, Jeff Bezos, and its CEO, Andy Jassy, as part of a year-long investigation into whether the e-commerce giant has illegally pushed Amazon Prime and other subscription services onto consumers.

Amazon AMZN In a filing to the Federal Trade Commission dated August 5 and recently made public,accused the agency of making "burdensome" legal requests that "serve no other purpose than to harass Amazon's highest-ranking executives and disrupt its business operations."
