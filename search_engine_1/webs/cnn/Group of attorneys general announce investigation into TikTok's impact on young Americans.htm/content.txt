(CNN Business) A nationwide group of state attorneys general announced an investigation into TikTok's impact on young Americans Tuesday, adding to the steady drumbeat of political pressure being applied to social media platforms.

The probe zeroes in on TikTok's user engagement techniques and alleged risks that the platform may pose to the mental health of children, according to announcements by the states.

In a statement, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong cited "reckless viral challenges" on TikTok as a major source of concern. He added that while TikTok has made some moves to limit harms to children, "our investigation will look at what TikTok knew about the risks to our children, and precisely what they have been doing to keep our kids online."

The list of participating states includes California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee and Vermont.
