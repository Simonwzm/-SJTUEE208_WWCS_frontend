Washington, DC (CNN Business) Uber and Alphabet's Waymo, which were once embroiled in a lawsuit over self-driving technology, are now working together on fully autonomous trucks.

The companies announced Tuesday a "long-term strategic partnership" to deploy Waymo's self-driving trucks on Uber Freight, a logistics platform that matches trucks with businesses shipping goods. Carriers purchasing trucks with Waymo technology will have the option to use Uber Freight to find customers. Waymo and manufacturing partners like Daimler Trucks are not yet offering Waymo trucks for sale, so the Uber partnership is intended to begin with Waymo's test fleet in the next 12 months. Waymo says the trucks will be available for sale "in the coming years," according to Waymo spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. The company hasn't revealed a specific timeline.

Levandowski was later fired, and the companies settled the suit in 2018 . Waymo received equity in Uber that worked out to about $245 million at the time, far less than the $1.8 billion it originally sought. Levandowski was sentenced to 18 months in prison, but was pardoned by President Trump in 2021. The lawsuit was a significant blow to Uber's self-driving efforts, which it later sold to the autonomous transportation company Aurora in 2020

Uber's Lior Ron has gone from being involved in a lawsuit with Waymo, to partnering with it.

Lior Ron, Levandowski's co-founder at Otto, has remained with Uber since the saga, and leads Uber Freight.
