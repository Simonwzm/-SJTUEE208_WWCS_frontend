Hong Kong (CNN Business) Xiaomi has won at least a temporary reprieve from a US ban on Americans investing in the Chinese smartphone maker.

The Trump-era ban was halted Friday by a US federal judge, who ruled that Washington lacked "substantial evidence" to support its claim that Xiaomi is owned or controlled by China's military.

Days before President Joe Biden took office in January, the US Department of Defense added Xiaomi to a list of companies it claimed were linked to the Chinese military. Businesses on the list were subject to harsh restrictions, including the American investment ban.

Had US District Judge Rudolph Contreras not issued a preliminary injunction, the ban would have taken effect Monday, according to court documents.

Shares of Xiaomi spiked as much as 12% on Monday in Hong Kong. The stock was last up more than 7%, on track for its best day since December.
