Chris Isidore (CNN) Consumer Reports gave the Tesla Model Y SUV a "not recommended" rating because of significant reliability problems, dragging the brand to near the bottom of the magazine's industry-wide reliability ranking.

The Model Y, the carmaker's newest model which began production at the start of this year, is expected to become Tesla's best-selling vehicle . It got good ratings overall from Consumer Reports' staff during test drives earlier this year. But the reliability rankings are based on a survey of actual owners -- who reported significant problems.

"A car might be great to drive and have all the features you want," said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, "but all that won't matter to you much if you have to keep going back to the dealer for repairs."

The problems with the Model Y ranged from misaligned body panels to mismatched paint. One owner reported dust, debris, and even human hair stuck in the paint.

Fisher said new vehicles often have reliability problems but Tesla's issues are unusually bad.
