(Reuters) A group of drivers for Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) on Tuesday accused the companies of unfairly controlling how much passengers are charged for rides in an antitrust lawsuit in California state court.

The lawsuit seeking class action status in San Francisco Superior Court alleged violations of California antitrust law, and state law prohibiting unfair business practices.

The drivers claimed that if they were able to offer lower prices to the consumers, it would provide drivers with "the most competitive compensation."

"By preventing drivers from doing so, Uber and Lyft harm competition in both the labor market as well as the consumer market," the complaint alleged. "Customers pay more, and drivers earn less."

An Uber spokesperson said in a statement that the "complaint misconstrues both the facts and the applicable law and we intend to defend ourselves accordingly."
