(CNN) The Wing, the once-buzzy social club and luxury coworking community geared towards women, has shuttered all of its remaining locations.

The six-year-old startup, which had raised more than $100 million in funding towards building out its network of physical spaces that were intended to look and feel like feminist utopias, said its six remaining spaces are closed for good.

At its height, the company had nearly a dozen locations. Its first location outside the US opened in London in the fall of 2019, mere months before the pandemic would halt use of its members-only spaces.

According to an automated email response from one of its New York City locations, the company has "arranged for workspace and membership needs to be fulfilled" by the International Workplace Group, or IWG. In February 2021, the flexible workspace behemoth, with a network of 1,000 US locations, acquired a majority stake in The Wing following the many months of turmoil.
