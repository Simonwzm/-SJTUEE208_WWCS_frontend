New York (CNN Business) The Facebook Oversight Board was designed to make some of Facebook's most difficult decisions for the company. But on Wednesday the board put one of the biggest dilemmas facing the platform back on Facebook (FB) and company CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

The board said Facebook was right to suspend Trump in the immediate aftermath of the January 6th insurrection, but said Facebook couldn't just make the suspension "indefinite" with no actual rule on its books allowing for that. The board said Facebook must review the decision and figure out if Trump should be banned from the platform forever.

The board could have made that decision itself. To some it might appear that, in not doing so, it was trying to pass the buck, not wanting to make a controversial call or test its authority.

But by choosing to hand the decision back to Facebook, it put Zuckerberg's powerful role in overseeing public discourse in the United States in the spotlight, along with the arbitrary nature of how Facebook moderates it platform. Forcing Facebook to make the decision was in itself an exercise of the board's power and independence.

The decision was in many ways not just about Trump. It may ultimately be more important for parts that were really only secondarily about him. The ruling was a shot across Facebook's bow, warning the company that it has to get its house in order and can no longer make world-altering decisions on the fly.
