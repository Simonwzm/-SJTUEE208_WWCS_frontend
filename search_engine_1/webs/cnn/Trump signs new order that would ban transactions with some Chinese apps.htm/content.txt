Hong Kong (CNN Business) President Donald Trump is continuing to pile the pressure on Chinese tech companies in the closing days of his administration.

Tencent's TCTZF Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group's Alipay . The order will also hitQQ Wallet and WeChat Pay, as well as the apps CamScanner, SHAREit, VMate and WPS Office.

The "continuing activity" of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party "to steal or otherwise obtain United States persons' data makes clear that there is an intent to use bulk data collection to advance China's economic and national security agenda," the order reads in part.

It's not at all clear how effective this order will be. It is set to take effect 45 days from now, well after Trump leaves office.

Prior orders that Trump has issued against Chinese tech firms have run into trouble. An order banning WeChat downloads in the United States was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, for example. Multiple courts have also issued temporary injunctions against the administration's attempts to ban the short-form video app TikTok.
