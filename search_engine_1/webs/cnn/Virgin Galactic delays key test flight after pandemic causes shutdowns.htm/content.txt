New York (CNN Business) Virgin Galactic said Monday that it no longer plans to conduct a key test flight of its spacecraft this week because of a surge in new Covid-19 cases and resulting related restrictions in New Mexico, home to the company's glitzy spaceport.

Business activity and large gatherings have been banned in the state through at least November 30. New Mexico has reported over 1,000 new cases each day for the past ten days, according to Johns Hopkins University.Business activity and large gatherings have been banned in the state through at least November 30.

Virgin Galactic, which had been operating as an "essential business" at its manufacturing and development facilities in California, was expected to conduct its first-ever test flight at its New Mexico spaceport. That's the location that Galactic hopes wealthy thrill seekers will flock to before they board one of the companies rocket-powered planes for a brief trip to the edge of space.

That test flight was expected to take off this week, but the company said in a statement they had consulted with New Mexico officials and decided to reschedule the flight. There is no new predicted test flight date in place.

Virgin Galactic's statement also said the company plans to minimize its operations in New Mexico.
