Hong Kong (CNN Business) Huawei has been battered by a long US campaign against the company. Now it is hunkering down for survival by selling off its budget smartphone business.

A consortium of buyers said on Tuesday that it has acquired Huawei's Honor smartphone brand for an undisclosed amount of money. The buyers include more than 30 Chinese agents and dealers of the budget brand.
