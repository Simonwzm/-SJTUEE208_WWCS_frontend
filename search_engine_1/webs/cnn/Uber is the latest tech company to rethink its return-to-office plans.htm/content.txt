San Francisco (CNN Business) Less than three months after announcing that its employees would be required to come back to the office at least three days a week, Uber is backtracking.

The ride-hailing company will give its global office workers the option to apply for fully remote work or choose from a list of other offices instead of their pre-pandemic location, the company's chief people officer, Nikki Krishnamurthy, said in a blog post Tuesday.

Uber UBER For those who choose to come back to the office,is asking that they spend at least 50% of their time there, but it is offering more flexibility on how this time can be structured. "This can be 3 days one week and 2 days the next week, or 5 days one week and 0 days the next week, depending on what works best for the employee and their team," Krishnamurthy said.

It's a sharp reversal for Uber and points to the challenges for Silicon Valley's biggest companies — which built the products that enabled remote work for many households throughout the pandemic — in striking the right telework balance with their employees as the pandemic eases.

Like Uber, Google initially announced it would require workers to come back to their pre-pandemic offices a few days a week only to loosen that policy later by allowing employees to apply for permanent remote work or to change their office location.
