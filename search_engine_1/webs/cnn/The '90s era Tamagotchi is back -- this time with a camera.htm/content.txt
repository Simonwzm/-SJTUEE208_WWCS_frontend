New York (CNN Business) The Tamagotchi is back, but this time the '90s icon comes with a camera.

Bandai America, its parent company, is launching the new Tamagotchi Pix. The core remains the same: an egg shape, three buttons, with the goal of raising a virtual pet. It goes through different life stages, such as hatching from an egg, and demands attention, like asking to be fed or played with. It dies a few days later.

2021. Instead of a pixelated black and white screen, the Pix screen is in full color. And there's a built-in camera that lets you take pictures with your virtual pet. To feed your Tamagotchi, you can cook for it or have food delivered. You can also nurture the pet by painting or cooking with it using the camera to snap pictures for your pet.

The $59.99 toy, available for pre-orders now, goes on sale in July.
