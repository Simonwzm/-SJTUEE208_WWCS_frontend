New Delhi (CNN Business) India's main opposition party is accusing Twitter of stifling freedom of speech after the company took action against hundreds of tweets that identified the family of a child who was allegedly raped and murdered.

Twitter's TWTR decision followed a call from India's child protection agency to block access to tweets it said identified a 9-year old girl who was killed in Delhi earlier this month. Police are investigating allegations of rape made by the victims' family and neighbors.

The girl was a member of the Dalit community, the most oppressed group in India's Hindu system of caste hierarchy. Four men have been arrested, though they have not yet been charged.

The incident prompted a judicial inquiry and sparked days of protests from outraged villagers and activists who think Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not done enough to address longstanding sexual assault problems.

Some of Modi's most vocal critics include members of the Congress party, the country's main opposition. Senior Congress leader and MP Rahul Gandhi tweeted August 4 a photo of him with the girl's parents, adding the caption: "The parents' tears say one thing â€” their daughter, the daughter of the country, deserves justice."
