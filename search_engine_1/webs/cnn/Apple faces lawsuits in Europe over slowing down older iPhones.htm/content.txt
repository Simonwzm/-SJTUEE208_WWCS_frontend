London (CNN Business) Apple is facing new legal action in Europe over its controversial practice of slowing down older iPhones.

Euroconsumers, the advocacy group bringing the action, said in a statement Wednesday that the class-action lawsuits cover up to 2 million iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus devices in Belgium, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

Apple has faced public backlash and legal action around the world after it admitted in 2017 that software updates designed to prevent the batteries in older iPhones from crashing also slowed the devices down.

The Euroconsumers cases mirror a class action lawsuit against Apple in the United States that led to a proposed settlement of $500 million in March. Last month, Apple paid $113 million to settle an investigation into the matter by 34 American states, including California and Arizona.

"We're being asked to be treated with the same fairness and respect as US consumers," head of policy and enforcement at Euroconsumers, Els Bruggeman told CNN Business.
