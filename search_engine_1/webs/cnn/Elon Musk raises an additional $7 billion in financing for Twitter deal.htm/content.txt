New York (CNN Business) Elon Musk has raised just over $7 billion in additional equity financing to help fund his purchase of Twitter.

The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a new Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure Musk filed Wednesday.

Twitter TWTR Musk last month entered an agreement to buyin a deal worth roughly $44 billion, which is expected to close later this year. The deal came together quickly after Musk revealed he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions, and an equity commitment from himself.

Twitter stock rose more than 3% Thursday, indicating the new financing has increased investors' confidence that the acquisition will go through.

The additional $7.14 billion in equity financing means that the margin loan Musk had secured from Morgan Stanley for the deal has been reduced from $12.5 billion to $6.25 billion, lowering the burden of the deal on the Tesla CEO himself. The new investors also include venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Witkoff Capital and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Meanwhile, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal will commit roughly 35 million shares of Twitter to stay invested in the company after the deal goes through, according to the filing.
