New York (CNN Business) SpaceX is claiming it will accept dogecoin — the somewhat satirical but popular cryptocurrency — as payment for an upcoming mission.

A Canadian company called the Geometric Energy Corporation confirmed that it will pay SpaceX solely in dogecoin in order to secure a spot for an 88-pound satellite on a mission, called Doge-1, slated to take off in early 2022. The satellite will "obtain lunar-spatial intelligence from sensors and cameras," according to a press release.

"This is not a joke," Geometric Energy Corporation CEO Samuel Reid said via phone. He declined further comment about the deal.

Dogecoin, however, did start as a joke: The digital currency was founded by two software engineers in 2013, and its value and popularity are inextricably linked to internet memeworthiness and viral social media posts. Still, dogecoin has been propelled into one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, and it counts SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as one of its most vehement and popular supporters. He's frequently shared dogecoin-centric jokes on Twitter and claimed the cryptocurrency is " underestimated ."

The announcement that Musk's space company would accept dogecoin as payment came the day after the CEO's appearance on "Saturday Night Live" appeared to trigger a sell-off of the currency. Musk said during a segment on the show that the coin was "a hustle," and the coin's trading price later plunged 40% . Still, the cryptocurrency has been on an absolute tear this year: It's up more than 12,000% since January and has gained 800% this month alone.
