(CNN) A voting app created by allies of prominent Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was removed from Google and Apple's online stores in Russia just as polls opened for parliamentary elections, according to a series of tweets from Navalny's team on Friday.

Ivan Zhdanov, a key ally of the jailed dissident, tweeted an image of an email he said was from Apple confirming the app was blocked. The email said the app, also called Navalny, was removed because Russia designates the Kremlin critic's anti-corruption foundation as "extremist," a reference to his now outlawed political movement. The app therefore contained content that is considered "illegal" in the country.

The Navalny app included recommendations for the opposition leader's "Smart Voting" strategy, which urges Russians to vote tactically in support of a candidate most capable of unseating an incumbent from the ruling party, United Russia, in the State Duma elections. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it considers the voting strategy to be a "provocation" and harmful to voters.

American tech companies have been under an immense amount of pressure from the Russian government in recent months. Some have been handed down fines for not removing content that authorities consider to be "extremist" or "undesirable." And Russian state media reported earlier this week that bailiffs visited Russia's Google office on Monday.

Russia's internet watchdog Roskomnadzor has been demanding that Google and Apple remove the "Navalny" app from their online stores. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement last Friday claiming the US Ambassador to Russia had been "summoned" to be told Russia has "irrefutable evidence of the violation of Russian legislation by the American digital giants" in regard to the elections.
