New York (CNN Business) United Airlines gave a $10 million deposit to a startup developing electric aircraft â€” all for the goal of shuttling customers to and from the airport by air rather than gridlocked roadways.

It's not clear when or if the plan will come to fruition, as Archer, the company developing the electric air taxis, is still in the development phase. However, the company said Wednesday that's it's finishing the design of its production model. Archer estimates the first of its four-seater helicopters could be in operation by 2024.

California-based Archer, which was founded in 2018, has raised nearly a billion dollars, according to analytics company Crunchbase . It refers to its aircraft as an eVTOL, or "electric vertical takeoff and landing" configuration. The company states they'll be able to travel up to 60 miles at up to 150 miles per hour. The aircraft is expected to lift off much like a helicopter, and it'll rotate its propellers from providing vertical to horizontal thrust while airborne, and then rely on conventional wings to keep it in the air as it moves forward.

The company claims its vehicles will be able to land on helicopter pads and more general infrastructure such as the tops of parking garages, according to its website . It also claims the eVTOLs will be quieter than traditional helicopters, clocking in at 45 dBA, which would be softer than the ambient sound of an urban downtown.

Archer is conducting weekly test flights of its earliest vehicle, according to its website, but whether the future includes skies dotted with electric taxis depends on whether Archer can get past several major hurdles. The company has to prove its electric-powered aircraft work can be produced on an affordable scale and get regulatory approval to take to the skies.
