(CNN Business) After years of slowly gaining traction, telemedicine exploded during the pandemic. Now companies are using that momentum to usher in the next wave of remote health, by moving beyond just chats with doctors to a high-tech world of healthcare access without leaving the home.

"The pandemic really supported new ways for remote monitoring, creation and development of devices," said Dr. John Batsis, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. "When there's consumer need, there's going to be startups and equity and businesses that are trying to meet those needs."

One company rethinking televisits is Tyto Care , an on-demand medical exam company that aims to replicate in-person visits with home medical kits. CEO and co-founder Dedi Gilad came up with the concept eight years ago when his daughter suffered from recurring ear and throat infections. "I found myself doing a lot of unnecessary travels to the pediatrician to really take care of her," he told CNN. "And then the thinking was, how can I make this entire interaction from home?"

Tyto Care kits allow doctors to remotely monitor symptoms in a patient's ears, heart, lungs, and throat, as well as take basic vital signs. The devices, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have small built-in cameras so doctors can virtually see inside the ears or throat, and help identify cardiovascular respiratory conditions.

While the kits were originally developed for pediatric use, interest among adults surged during the pandemic. Gilad said demand for Tyto Care's home diagnostic kits among consumers increased 500% -- and 400% by physicians -- in recent months and has been used by 350,000 patients to date.
