Hong Kong (CNN Business) China will set up a new stock exchange in Beijing, giving the nation's capital and political center more influence in the world of business and finance.

President Xi Jinping announced the Beijing-based exchange at an international trade fair on Thursday, saying that he wanted to create a venue for "service-oriented" and "innovative" businesses. He did not say when the exchange would be established.

China already has two stock exchanges on the mainland, but they are located in Shanghai and Shenzhen, far away from Beijing. The Shanghai Stock Exchange, which was established in 1990, hosts mostly large-cap companies, including state-owned enterprises, banks and energy firms. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange has a bigger proportion of tech companies and small or medium-sized firms.

There's also the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but it is subject to its own legal and regulatory systems and is free of Beijing's capital controls.

The move comes as the Chinese government's regulatory crackdown on large private companies intensifies. Beijing has been working for nearly a year to rein in their power and influence.
