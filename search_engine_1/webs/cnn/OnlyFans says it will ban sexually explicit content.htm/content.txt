New York / Hong Kong (CNN Business) OnlyFans is banning sexually explicit content starting in October, the company announced Thursday.

"In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines," the company said in a statement, adding that the changes come after requests from "banking partners and payout providers."

It's a massive shift for a service that has become a major space for adult content as the creator economy has exploded. Like other social platforms, OnlyFans allows its creators to either offer content for free, or else wall their live-streams, videos and messages behind paid subscriptions. Creators can also earn revenue through tips or paid messages.

The website, which was founded in 2016, says it has 130 million users. It pays out more than $5 billion to its creators — who number more than 1.5 million — each year.

OnlyFans markets itself as a place where photographers, musicians, make-up artists, actors and other creators can earn part or even full-time incomes.
