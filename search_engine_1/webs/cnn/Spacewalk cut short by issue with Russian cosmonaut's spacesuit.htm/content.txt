New York (CNN Business) A spacewalk was cut short just a few hours into what was intended to be a nearly seven-hour spacewalk after a Russian cosmonaut was repeatedly ordered to drop what he was working on and return to the International Space Station's airlock because of an issue with his spacesuit.

NASA officials said during a livestream that the cosmonaut, Oleg Artemyev, was never in any danger. Still, issues with the battery pack that powers his spacesuit were concerning enough for flight controllers to urgently order him to return to the space station and attach his suit to ISS power. The battery issues were causing "voltage fluctuations" in Artemyev's spacesuit, according to commentary on the spacewalk livestream

Officials on the ground gave Artemyev several warnings that he needed to return to the airlock.

A Russian cosmonaut was ordered to return to the International Space Station's airlock because of an issue with his spacesuit.

"Drop everything and start going back right away," was one of the last dispatches from the ground before Artemyev confirmed he was headed for the airlock. A few minutes later, he was able to re-enter the space station and hook his suit up to its power.

Cosmonaut Denis Matveev, who was working alongside Artemyev on the spacewalk, remained just outside the space station's airlock for more than an hour until flight controllers decided to end the spacewalk early because of Artemyev's spacesuit issues.
